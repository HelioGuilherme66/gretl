version 1.7.7, in progress

Ordered probit and logit: the presentation of the cut-points in
ordered response models is now that used by Stata and R, not
by William Greene as previously.  That is, we don't estimate a
generic constant, but report n-1 cut points, where n is the
number of response levels.

List arguments to user-defined arguments:

In the context of a "foreach" loop across such a list, the
accessor $i still gets the name of the variable at position i 
in the list, but the variable is not "visible" by that name
within the function.  To get a handle on the variable (e.g.
for use on the right-hand side of a genr command), use the
new syntax listname.varname.  See the chapter on functions in
the User's Guide for details.

$sigma and $vcv accessors:

The $sigma and $vcv accessors have been changed for some model 
types. Now $sigma always refers to a measure associated with the 
residual variance, while $vcv always refer to the variance of
the parameter estimates.

In the case of VARs/VECMs, $vcv formerly referred to the cross-
equation covariance of the residuals.  Now $sigma is used for
that purpose; $vcv gets the variance of the coefficients, which
was not previously accessible.

logical operators:

We are now enforcing what the gretl manual has said for quite
some time: logical OR is represented by "||" and logical AND
by "&&".  The single "|" is now reserved for row-wise matrix
concatenation, and the single "&" for "taking the address of"
a variable.  Previously we tried to guess when "|" and "&" were
intended to represent OR and AND respectively, as in the
original gretl syntax, but no more.

3/21/2008 version 1.7.4

The old "multiply" command has been removed.

The old commands "corc", "hilu" and "pwe" are consolidated
into a new one, "ar1".  The old command words remain as
aliases but their use is deprecated.

2/29/2008 version 1.7.3

You cannot define a user-function having the same name as
a built-in function.
