version 1.7.5, in progress

$sigma and $vcv accessors:

The $sigma and $vcv accessors have been changed for some model 
types. Now $sigma always refers to a measure associated with the 
residual variance, while $vcv always refer to the variance of
the parameter estimates.

In the case of VARs/VECMs, $vcv formerly referred to the cross-
equation covariance of the residuals.  Now $sigma is used for
that purpose; $vcv gets the variance of the coefficients, which
was not previously accessible.

The old "multiply" command has been removed.

The old commands "corc", "hilu" and "pwe" are consolidated

aliases but their use is deprecated.
