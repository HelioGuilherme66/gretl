/*
Besides the distinction between "internally" and "externally" studentized residuals there is a (quantitatively minor) difference between the formula for the latter given in wikipedia and that employed in R's rstudent() function. For discussion of the latter see

https://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/204708/is-studentized-residuals-v-s-standardized-residuals-in-lm-model

And whaddya know? Our original code for standardized residuals agrees exactly with rstudent(), while our new "corrected" code (per wikipedia) is close but not an exact match.

# series studres = $uhat / ($sigma * sqrt(1 - h))
# New += studres

--> Thus, we do not test for equivalence of studres here.
