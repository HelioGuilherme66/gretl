/*
Bug in before 2024b.
Allin's explanation: "The thing is that s1 was the original char * value
attached to the uservar s, the target for replacement. Since s1 was
just two bytes (space plus NUL) and the replacement was three (é plus
NUL) s1 couldn't just be reused, it had to be replaced. And in doing
so we do want to free the unused s1. However, what was overlooked here
is that the function used to effect the replacement,
user_var_replace_value(), already takes care of freeing the original
data pointer on the uservar in question. So basically the solution was
just, delete line 12320."

string s = " "
s[1] = "é"   # crash happens here


print "Succesfully finished tests."
