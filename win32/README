This directory contains materials for building the win32 version of
gretl.  The files are set up for cross-compilation under Linux using
the mingw C compiler -- it should be possible to modify them for a
native mingw build on the win32 platform.

If you want to build gretl for win32 yourself you will need to get
some additional files, and to modify the scripts here to suit your own
setup.

A. Additional files:

1. GTK+ for win32 (with iconv and libintl): glib version 2.0 and also
   gdk/gtk version 2.0.  See http://www.gimp.org/~tml/gimp/win32/ The
   glib/gdk/gtk DLLs should be placed in a subdirectory named "dlls"
   of this directory.

2. libxml, libreadline, zlib and gmp

For all of the above, you need DLLs, import libraries (.a) and
headers.  See http://mingwrep.sourceforge.net/ for a repository of
such packages.  For convenience, I have assembled a zip archive,
gretl-win32-build.zip, which contains all that is needed in regard
to libxml, libreadline, zlib and gmp. See

  ftp://ricardo.ecn.wfu.edu/pub/gretl/winbuild/

3. The Inno Setup compiler for making a self-installing executable
   See http://www.jrsoftware.org/

4. The gnuplot for win32 distribution.  
   See ftp://ricardo.ecn.wfu.edu/pub/gretl/winbuild/ (preferable)
   or ftp://ftp.gnuplot.info/pub/gnuplot/


B. Modifications to scripts:

1. At the top of the shell script, mkwindist, you will need to enter
correct settings for (a) the location of the zipfile containing
gnuplot for win32, and (b) the path to the Inno Setup compiler.  If you
are building on win32 you will have to make further changes to this
script (e.g., as it stands, the Inno compiler is called using wine).

2. Adjust the settings in config.mk to match your system.

3. You may have to change the path to the perl interpreter in the perl
scripts builddate.pl and windist/make_iss.pl

When you have everything in place you can do "make" to build gretl for
win32, and "make dist" to build the installer executable for gretl.
If all goes well, you should find gretl_install.exe in windist/Output.

In anyone wants to contribute a set of scripts that work for a build 
of gretl actually on win32 (or even using the MS C compiler), please
do so and and I'll add them to this directory.
