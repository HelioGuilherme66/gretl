This directory contains materials for building the win32 version of
gretl.  The files are set up for cross-compilation under Linux using
the mingw C compiler -- it should be possible to modify them for a
native mingw build on the win32 platform.

If you want to build gretl for win32 yourself you will need to get
some additional files, and to modify the scripts here to suit your own
setup.

1. Additional files:

* GTK+ for win32 (with iconv and libintl), glib version 2.0 and
  gdk/gtk version 1.3.  See http://www.gimp.org/~tml/gimp/win32/

* libxml, libreadline, zlib and gtkextra

For all of the above, you need DLLs, import libraries (.a) and
headers.  See http://mingwrep.sourceforge.net/ for a repository of
such packages.  For convenience, I have assembled a zip archive,
gretl-win32-build.zip, which contains all that is needed in regard
to libxml, libreadline, zlib and gtkextra. See

  ftp://ricardo.ecn.wfu.edu/pub/gretl/winbuild/

* The Inno Setup compiler for making a self-installing executable
  See http://www.jrsoftware.org/

* The gnuplot for win32 distribution.  
  See ftp://ricardo.ecn.wfu.edu/pub/gretl/winbuild/ or
  ftp://ftp.gnuplot.info/pub/gnuplot/


2. Modifications to scripts:

* At the top of the shell script, mkwindist, you will need to enter
correct settings for (a) the location of the zipfile containing
gnuplot for win32 and (b) the path to the Inno Setup compiler.  If ou
are building on win32 you will have to make further changes to this
script (e.g., as it stands, the Inno compiler is called using wine).

* Near the top of the Makefile in this directory, enter the correct
path for the glib-2.0 headers on your system.

* You may have to change the path to the perl interpreter in the perl
scripts builddate.pl and windist/make_iss.pl
