Making a gretl update package (9/26/03)
=======================================

1. If GTK needs updating, this is not on.  The oldest gretl version
   that can be updated incrementally will the be the first-released
   version that uses the same GTK as the current gretl build.

Example, 9/26/03: gretl 1.1.2 updated to GTK 2.2.4 (and pango 1.2.5),
so we can't make an updater for anything earlier than 1.1.2.

2. How to determine which files need updating?  windist/MANIFEST gives
   a listing of all files installed by gretl_install.exe.  Take this
   as a basis and remove all the files that _don't_ need updating.

To help see which files do in fact need updating:

From Changelog: "09/09/03 version 1.1.2".  OK, let's make a stamp
with 

touch -t 200309030000 ~/gretl_marker 

test share:

find ~/src/share -newer ~/gretl_marker | grep -v CVS > update.files

test misc dlls:

find ~/stats/esl/win32/runtime/misc-dll -newer ~/gretl_marker >> update.files

3. The list based on MANIFEST, but with extraneous stuff deleted: trim
   the leading "gretl/" from filenames and make a tar listing, e.g.

   cat MANIFEST.copy | sed s+'^gretl/'++ > update.tarlist

4. Make a new dist, to get all updated files into windist/gretl.

5. Make an update tar package:

   cd windist/gretl
   tar cvzfT wgretl_update.tgz /path/to/update.tarlist

6. Ship to ricardo:

   scp wgretl_update.tgz cottrell@ricardo:./www-home/gretl/cgi-bin/updater
