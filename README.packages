This file aims to ease finding the correct packages as mentioned in the Gretl dependencies file (http://gretl.sourceforge.net/depend.html) and for different Linux distributions.

Each entry is the appropriate shell command to obtain the packages which then will allow to build gretl_x11 (libgretl and gretlcli too, of course).

It is organized by Linux distributions and expects your contributions to validate and expand to new distributions.
