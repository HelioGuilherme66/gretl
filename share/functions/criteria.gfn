Computes the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC), Schwarz's Bayesian
Information Criterion (BIC), the Hannan-Quinn criterion (HQC) and the
corrected AIC (AICc), given ess (error sum of squares), the number of
observations (n) and the number of coefficients (k).

The AIC is computed as in Akaike's original (1974) formulation, 
namely AIC = -2L + 2k, where L denotes the maximized log-likelihood. 

The BIC is computed as BIC = -2L + k log n.

The HQC is computed as HQC = -2L + 2k log log n.

The AICc is AIC with a correction for small sample size, to remedy
the tendency for AIC to overfit. It is computed as follows:
AICc = AIC + (2*k(k+1)) / (n-k-1).

A row vector containing the four criteria is available for assignment
on return.
