This simple package contains a single function with this signature:

matrix criteria (scalar ess, int n, int k, bool quiet[0])

It computes the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC), Schwarz's Bayesian
Information Criterion (BIC), the Hannan-Quinn criterion (HQC) and the
corrected AIC (AICc), given ess (error sum of squares), the number of
observations (n) and the number of coefficients (k).

Following estimation of a model in gretl the quantities wanted as
arguments for criteria() can be accessed as $ess, $T and $ncoeff,
respectively.

The AIC is computed as in Akaike's original (1974) formulation, 
namely AIC = -2L + 2k, where L denotes the maximized log-likelihood. 

The BIC is computed as BIC = -2L + k log n

The HQC is computed as HQC = -2L + 2k log log n

The AICc is AIC with a correction for small sample size, to remedy
the tendency for AIC to overfit. It is computed as follows:

AICc = AIC + (2*k(k+1)) / (n-k-1)

A row vector containing the four criteria is available for assignment
on return. If you just want this vector you can give a non-zero value
for the optional &quot;quiet&quot; argument to suppress printed output.
