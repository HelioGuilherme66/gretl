Sets of series that I truncated due to data problems (mixed
frequencies and other missing obs).

A. Consumer sentiment indices:

  U0M058 58. Consumer sentiment, NSA (1966:I=100) COPYRIGHTED (U of Mich)
  A0M122 122. Index of consumer confidence (1985=100) 
  A0M123 123. Index of consumer expectations (1985=100) 

I moved the start of these to 1978, from which point they are
available on a consistent monthly basis.  Some earlier data are available.

B. Trade series:

  A0Q618 618. Merchandise exports, adjusted, excluding military (mil. $) 
  A0Q620 620. Merchandise imports, adjusted, excluding military (mil. $)  
  A0Q622 622. Balance on merchandise trade (mil. $) 

Moved start to 1960, when quarterly data become available (annual only from
1946 to 1959).

C. Mortgage yields:

  U0M118 118. Secondary market yields on FHA mortgages, NSA (pct.)
  
Due to many missing observations in earlier periods I moved the start 
to 1981.   

D. Special cases:

  A0M113 113. Net change in consumer installment credit (AR, bil. $)
  A0M039 39. Consumer installment loans delinquent 30 days & over (pct.)
  A0M112 112. Net change in business loans (AR, bil. $)   

These have some missing obs in the middle: I set these to the ESL
missing code of -999.0
  
  U0M525 525. Defense Department prime contract awards in US, NSA (mil.$)
  
Truncated at 1988 due to missing obs.
