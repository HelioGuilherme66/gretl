when create data set by selection from database, or via the
built-in spreadsheet:

prior to saving the data, the dataframe label should not
just read "No datafile loaded" but something more informative,
such as "Data modified" (?)

once the data are _saved_, the name of the datafile should
appear in the main gretl window, and the Session menu
should be activated.
