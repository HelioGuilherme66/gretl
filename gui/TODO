? Make the "edit graph using GUI" use the PNG graph mechanism
rather than a pipe to gnuplot.

? Shift to PNG graph mechanism under win32 (trade-off: have to
reconstruct the options that are currently offered under the win32
gnuplot menus -- copy to clipboard (nicely scaled), print (ditto),
change line styles and so on.
