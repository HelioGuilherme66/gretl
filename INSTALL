Gretl uses GNU autoconf.  Here's the quick way to get going:

  ./configure
  make
  make install

* You may want to do "./configure --help" first to see what options are
available.  

* By default the installation goes under /usr/local.  To install elsewhere
use "./configure --prefix=/your/prefix".  See also the notes on gnome
below.

* On systems where GNU make is not the default you may need to use the
"--with-gmake" option to ./configure.

* To build the gui client you'll need a working installation of GTK+ 1.2.3 
or higher.  See http://www.gtk.org.

* The gretl configure script looks for the gnome desktop, and arranges for
gretl to be built with gnome support if gnome is found on your system.
If you want to disable this, add the option "--without-gnome" when
running ./configure.  

By default, gnome-specific gretl files (e.g. pixmaps, help files, the
gretl.desktop file) are installed under the prefix that is returned by the
command "gnome-config --prefix".  This will generally be correct, but if
you want to override this behavior you may use the option
"--with-gnome-install=DIR" when running configure. Substitute for "DIR"
the prefix you want to use.

* The programs here call on gnuplot to generate graphs.  As of this
writing the latest gnuplot can be obtained from:
