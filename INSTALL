Gretl uses GNU autoconf.  Here's the quick way to get going:

  ./configure
  make
  make check
  make install

* You may want to do "./configure --help" first to see what options are
  available.

* By default the installation goes under /usr/local.  To install
  elsewhere use "./configure --prefix=/your/prefix".

* Packagers who are using DESTDIR when building a gretl package
  should use the "--disable-xdg-utils" option so that gretl's XDG
  files get installed to DESTDIR rather than to the standard system
  location.

* Gretl requires that a LAPACK library is available. Two variants
  should be auto-detected -- libopenblas, and liblapack plus
  libblas -- provided the libraries are in a location searched by the
  linker by default. In case of other configurations, such as ATLAS
  or the Intel Math Kernel library (MKL) or openblas in a non-standard
  location, you should provide an appropriate linker line in the
  environment variable LAPACK_LIBS when calling the configure script.
  For example, for openblas installed under /opt:

  LAPACK_LIBS='-L/opt/openblas/lib -lopenblas' ./configure ...

* On systems where GNU make is not the default you may need to use the
  "--with-gmake" option to ./configure.
