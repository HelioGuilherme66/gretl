Gretl uses GNU autoconf.  Here's the quick way to get going:

  ./configure
  make
  make install

* You may want to do "./configure --help" first to see what options are
available.  

* By default the installation goes under /usr/local.  To install elsewhere
use "./configure --prefix=/your/prefix". 

* On systems where GNU make is not the default you may need to use the
"--with-gmake" option to ./configure.

* To build the gui client you'll need a working installation of GTK+ 1.2.3 
or higher.  See http://www.gtk.org.

* The programs here call on gnuplot to generate graphs.  As of this
writing the latest gnuplot can be obtained from:
