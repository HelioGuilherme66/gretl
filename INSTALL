Gretl uses GNU autoconf.  Here's the quick way to get going:

  ./configure
  make
  make install

* You may want to do "./configure --help" first to see what options are
  available.  

* By default the installation goes under /usr/local.  To install
  elsewhere use "./configure --prefix=/your/prefix".  See also the
  notes on gnome below.

* On systems where GNU make is not the default you may need to use the
  "--with-gmake" option to ./configure.

Dependencies: gretl relies on various libraries and auxiliary
programs, as follows:

Package     gretl status   functionality
===============================================================

gtk          required       provides the gretl GUI

gtkextra     required       file selection dialogs, session icon
                            view, data editing spreadsheet

xml          required       open and save data files in the
                            default format

gnuplot      required       generate graphs

gdk-pixbuf   recommended    handle graphs in PNG format; make
                            gnuplot graphs interactive

readline     optional       provides a nice editable command line
                            in gretlcli, the command-line program

gnome        optional       gretl is integrated into the gnome
                            desktop (file icons and associations,
                            HTML help system and so on)

=================================================================

Notes:

* It is possible to turn off the dependency on gdk-pixbuf by using the
  option "--disable-png-graphics" with configure.  You will still be
  able to generate graphs, they just won't be interactive.

* The gretl configure script looks for the gnome desktop, and arranges
  for gretl to be built with gnome support if gnome is found on your
  system.  If you want to disable this, add the option
  "--without-gnome" when running ./configure.

* By default, gnome-specific gretl files (e.g. pixmaps, help files,
  the gretl.desktop file) are installed under the prefix that is
  returned by the command "gnome-config --prefix".  This will
  generally be correct, but if you want to override this behavior you
  may use the option "--with-gnome-install=DIR" when running
  configure. Substitute for "DIR" the prefix you want to use.
