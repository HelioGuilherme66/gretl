Gretl uses GNU autoconf.  Here's the quick way to get going:

  ./configure
  make
  make install

* You may want to do "./configure --help" first to see what options are
available.  

* By default the installation goes under /usr/local.  To install elsewhere
use "./configure --prefix=/your/prefix". 

* On systems where GNU make is not the default you may need to use the
"--with-gmake" option to ./configure.

* To build the gui client you'll need a working installation of GTK+ 1.2.3 
or higher.  See http://www.gtk.org.

* The programs here call on gnuplot to generate graphs.  As of this
writing the latest gnuplot can be obtained from:

ftp://ftp.gnuplot.vt.edu/pub/gnuplot/gnuplot-3.7.1.tar.gz

* The gretl configure script looks for the gnome desktop, and arranges for
gretl to be built with gnome support if gnome is found on your system.
If you want to disable thus, add the option "--without-gnome" when
running ./configure.
