/*     subroutine qrsolv

     given an m by n matrix a, an n by n diagonal matrix d, 
     and an m-vector b, the problem is to determine an x which 
     solves the system 

           a*x = b ,     d*x = 0 , 

     in the least squares sense. 

     this subroutine completes the solution of the problem 
     if it is provided with the necessary information from the 
     qr factorization, with column pivoting, of a. that is, if 
     a*p = q*r, where p is a permutation matrix, q has orthogonal 
     columns, and r is an upper triangular matrix with diagonal 
     elements of nonincreasing magnitude, then qrsolv expects 
     the full upper triangle of r, the permutation matrix p, 
     and the first n components of (q transpose)*b. the system 
     a*x = b, d*x = 0, is then equivalent to 

                  t       t 
           r*z = q *b ,  p *d*p*z = 0 , 

     where x = p*z. if this system does not have full rank, 
     then a least squares solution is obtained. on output qrsolv 
     also provides an upper triangular matrix s such that 

            t   t               t 
           p *(a *a + d*d)*p = s *s . 

     s is computed within qrsolv and may be of separate interest. 

     the subroutine statement is 

       subroutine qrsolv(n,r,ldr,ipvt,diag,qtb,x,sdiag,wa) 

     where 

       n is a positive integer input variable set to the order of r. 

       r is an n by n array. on input the full upper triangle 
         must contain the full upper triangle of the matrix r. 
         on output the full upper triangle is unaltered, and the 
         strict lower triangle contains the strict upper triangle 
         (transposed) of the upper triangular matrix s. 

       ldr is a positive integer input variable not less than n 
         which specifies the leading dimension of the array r. 

       ipvt is an integer input array of length n which defines the 
         permutation matrix p such that a*p = q*r. column j of p 
         is column ipvt(j) of the identity matrix. 

       diag is an input array of length n which must contain the 
         diagonal elements of the matrix d. 

       qtb is an input array of length n which must contain the first 
         n elements of the vector (q transpose)*b. 

       x is an output array of length n which contains the least 
         squares solution of the system a*x = b, d*x = 0. 

       sdiag is an output array of length n which contains the 
         diagonal elements of the upper triangular matrix s. 

       wa is a work array of length n.
