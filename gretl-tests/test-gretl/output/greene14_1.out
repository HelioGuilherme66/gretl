      Diagnostics: assuming a balanced panel with 6 cross-sectional units
                         observed over 15 periods

Fixed effects estimator
allows for differing intercepts by cross-sectional unit
slope standard errors in parentheses, p-values in brackets

6 group means were subtracted from the data

Residual variance: 0.292622/(90 - 9) = 0.00361262
Joint significance of differing group means:
 F(5, 81) = 57.7321 with p-value 2.80693e-25
(A low p-value counts against the null hypothesis that the pooled OLS model
is adequate, in favor of the fixed effects alternative.)


Means of pooled OLS residuals for cross-sectional units:

 unit  1:      0.068869
 unit  2:     -0.013878
 unit  3:      -0.19422
 unit  4:       0.15273
 unit  5:     -0.021583
 unit  6:     0.0080906

Breusch-Pagan test statistic:
 LM = 334.85 with p-value = prob(chi-square(1) > 334.85) = 8.44102e-75
(A low p-value counts against the null hypothesis that the pooled OLS model
is adequate, in favor of the random effects alternative.)

Variance estimators:
 between = 0.0155972
 within = 0.00361262
theta used for quasi-demeaning = 0.876685

                         Random effects estimator
           allows for a unit-specific component to the error term
           (standard errors in parentheses, p-values in brackets)

Hausman test statistic:
 H = 3.52343 with p-value = prob(chi-square(3) > 3.52343) = 0.317735
(A low p-value counts against the null hypothesis that the random effects
model is consistent, in favor of the fixed effects model.)
