I estimated the model without restrictions using STAMP 6.0. 
The results are:

Eq  1 : Estimated variances of disturbances.

Component          Var1 (q-ratio)  
Irr              767.01 ( 1.0000) 
Lvl              329.94 ( 0.4302) 
Slp             0.00000 ( 0.0000) 
Sea              41.031 ( 0.0535)

Cf. gretl (using Jack's BSM function)

V (4 x 1)

      766.95
      329.99
  1.1910e-10
      41.033

==========

With STAMP again, restricting the q-ration of  irregular and level 
to 1 and slope to zero I obtain:

Eq  2 : Estimated variances of disturbances.

Component          Var1 (q-ratio)  
Irr              547.16 ( 1.0000) 
Lvl              547.16 ( 1.0000) 
Slp         2.0656e-008 ( 0.0000) 
Sea              49.032 ( 0.0896)

There is a theoretical warning that seems proper in this case:
Page 170 in "Forecasting, Structural Time Series Models, and the Kalman 
Filter" (1989) by A.C. Harvey:

"When sigma^2_xi=0 (slope), convergence to the steady state does not take 
place exponentially fast and \bar{P} is not p.d. The slope component in this 
case is _deterministic_. One of the attractions of the kalman filter is that it 
can handle deterministic components. However, since \bar{P} is not p.d. a 
switch to the steady-state filter should not be made. An alternative way of 
handling the deterministic slope is to drop it from the state vector ..."
