DATA4-10:
    The following data file were compiled by Jeffrey Wong for the study
    involving parental school choice in the United States.  All data
    are for the year 1986, unless otherwise noted, for all 51 states,
    including the D.C.

   ENROLL = proportion of students that enroll in private schools.
            The data for private school enrollment for each state was
            found by indexing public school enrollment values of the years
            1980 and 1986.  This index was then used to calculate the
            private school enrollment for 1986.  Thus, the private school
            enrollment values are indexed numbers.  This should not cause
            any problem in the model because the enrollment trends in
            public and private education do not alter drastically from
            year to year.
