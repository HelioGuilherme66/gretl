Here's a comparison of the performance of the quadratic step-length
code as patched on 2013-01-06 wth the previous iteration.
Question marks against timing judgements indicate that I'm not
sure whether the difference is just noise.

arma + sarma: gradient evals up; function evals down; overal time up
slightly.

cluster: gradient evals up; function evals down; overall time down
slightly?

gig: still somewhat slower than with the simple step-length code; now
test3 completes OK but example4 fails: "numerical_hessian_inverse:
failed" for the Normal model, and no estimates produced for the Skewed
GED model ("non-p.d. G'G").

gmm: with the new weights normalization code I get 4 failures (CKLS,
hall, HS_HAC, HS_SE); without the new normalization only CKLS fails
but the gradient and function evals both increase very substantially
and the time taken increases by over 80 percent.

kalman: gradient and function evals down some, but overall time taken
goes up?

mle: gradient evals up; function evals down; overall time down
slightly?

SVAR: overall time indistinguishable.
