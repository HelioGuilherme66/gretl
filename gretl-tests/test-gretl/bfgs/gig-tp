new seems to fail test3.inp ("stopped after 500 iterations" on stderr,
 and the results do not agree with native garch)

newer: test3 now OK, but example4:
 first model 
   Hessian non-negative definite? (err = 44); dropping back to OPG
 Model: EGARCH(1,1) [Nelson] (Skewed GED)
   ESTIMATION FAILED: Matrix is not positive definite
