? corr x y --spearman

For the variables 'x' and 'y'
Spearman's rank correlation coefficient (rho) = 0.02379473
Under the null hypothesis of no correlation:
 t(198) = 0.334916, with two-tailed p-value 0.7380

? corr x y --kendall

For the variables 'x' and 'y'
Kendall's tau = 0.01598904
Under the null hypothesis of no correlation:
