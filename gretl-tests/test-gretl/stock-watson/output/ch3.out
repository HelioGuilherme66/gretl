Listing 4 variables:
  0) const    1) asex     2) year     3) ahe98  

? genr male = asex=1
Generated series male (ID 4)
? genr m_earn = zeromiss(male * ahe98)
Generated series m_earn (ID 5)
? genr f_earn = zeromiss((1-male) * ahe98)
Generated series f_earn (ID 6)

Full data range: 1 - 11130 (n = 11130)
Current sample: 1 - 2962 (n = 2962)

males:   mean = 17.57, sd = 7.50
females: mean = 15.22, sd = 5.97

Equality of means test (assuming unequal variances)

   m_earn: Number of observations = 1591
   f_earn: Number of observations = 1371
   Difference between sample means = 17.5746 - 15.2205 = 2.3541
   Null hypothesis: The two population means are the same.
   Estimated standard error = 0.247682
   Test statistic: t(2942) = 9.50454
   p-value (two-tailed) = 4.02464e-21
