Dataset Name:  Mavro (Filter Transmittance Data)

Description:   This is an observed/"real world" data set
               consisting of 50 transmittance measurements
               (at a sampling rate of 10 observations per second)
               from a filter with a nominal value of 2.
               The experimenter was Radu Mavrodineaunu,
               a member of the chemistry staff at NIST.
               We here use this data to test accuracy
               in summary statistics calculations.
