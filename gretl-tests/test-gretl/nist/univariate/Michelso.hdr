Dataset Name:  Michelso (Speed of Light Data, in millions of meters per second)

Description:   This is an observed/"real world" data set
               consisting of 100 measurements of the
               speed of light in air.  This classic experiment
               was carried out by Michelson is 1879.
               We here use this data to test accuracy
               in summary statistics calculations.

Stat Category: Univariate: Summary Statistics
