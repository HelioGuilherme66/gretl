Dataset Name:  Lottery

Description:   This is an observed/"real world" data set
               consisting of 218 lottery values
               from September 3, 1989 to April 14, 1990 (32 weeks).
               One 3-digit random number (from 000 to 999)
               is drawn per day, 7 days per week for most
               weeks, but fewer days per week for some weeks.
               We here use this data to test accuracy
               in summary statistics calculations.
