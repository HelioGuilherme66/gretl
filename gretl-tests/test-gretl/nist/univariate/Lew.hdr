Dataset Name:  Lew (Beam Deflection Data)

Description:   This is an observed/"real world" data set
               consisting of 200 deflections of a steel-concrete
               beam while subjected to periodic pressure.
               The experimenter was H. S. Lew of the
               Center for Building Technology at NIST.
               We here use this data to test accuracy
               in summary statistics calculations.
