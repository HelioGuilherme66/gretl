--------------------------------------------------------------
The input data includes more observations that those supported
by the De Wallis statistical table included in this function
For that reason, the test has been realized with the value
for 100 observations
--------------------------------------------------------------
The De Wallis test statistic is 0.209355
The result of the test is: We reject H0, there is evidence of negative autocorrelation
? print results
bundle results, created by DeWallis_test:
 De Wallis statisitic = 0.209355
 Test result = We reject H0, there is evidence of negative autocorrelation

Done
