# Simple example
? open data9-7

Read datafile /opt/esl/share/gretl/data/data9-7.gdt
periodicity: 4, maxobs: 64
observations range: 1975:1 to 1990:4

Listing 12 variables:
  0) const     1) QNC       2) PRICE     3) INCOME    4) PRIME   
  5) UNEMP     6) STOCK     7) POP       8) WINTER    9) SPRING  
 10) SUMMER   11) FALL

# Variant 1:
# We just want to find value of DHF statistics for series u
# and adequate critical value:
# including seasonal dummies:
? DHF_test(d_QNC, 0, 1, 0.1, 1)
H0: series has a seasonal unit root
DHF statistics:		-2.964098
10% critical value:	-3.780000
Decision: no evidence against the null (H0)

# including constant, without seasonal dummies:
? DHF_test(d_QNC, 1, 0, 0.1, 1)
H0: series has a seasonal unit root
DHF statistics:		-2.964187
10% critical value:	-2.010000
Decision: reject the null (H0)

# without constant and without seasonal dummies:
? DHF_test(d_QNC, 0, 0, 0.1, 1)
H0: series has a seasonal unit root
DHF statistics:		-2.958662
10% critical value:	-1.530000
Decision: reject the null (H0)

# Variant 2:
# We want to know if we should reject H0 (1) or not reject (0)
# including seasonal dummies:
Do we reject H0?	0
# we get 0: do not reject H0 - there is seasonal unit root
# including constant, without seasonal dummies:
Do we reject H0?	1
# we get 1: we reject H0 - there is not seasonal unit root
# without constant and without seasonal dummies:
Do we reject H0?	1
# we get 1: we reject H0 - there is not seasonal unit-root
Done
