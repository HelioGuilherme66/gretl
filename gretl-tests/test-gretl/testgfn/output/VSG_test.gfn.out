GVS TEST FOR DRIFT AND SHIFT IN A DRIFT
NULL HYPOTHESES: (i)  NO DRIFT
                 (ii) NO BREAK IN DRIFT
------------------------------------------
The R square test statistic (drift) is 0.89
 and the corresponding critical value is 0.93
The null hypothesis (no-drift) is not rejected
The null hypothesis (no-break) is not performed
#------------------------------------------------
# "10" accounts for the omitted observations at
# the  beginning (at at the end of the sample);
# "2"  chooses the level of the test, 5% in this
#      case;
# "1"  indicates that you are looking for a break
# "0"  indicates that you don't want to plot the
#      variable
? print TRIAL
