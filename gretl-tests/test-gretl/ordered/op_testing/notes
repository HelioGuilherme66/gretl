Ordered probit

Wooldridge, Econometric Analysis of Cross Section and Panel
Data, p. 506: "As with multinomial logit, for ordered
responses we can compute the percent correctly predicted, for
each outsome as well as overall: our prediction for $y$ is
simply the outcome with the highest probability."

Motivation
==========

Practitioners using the ordered probit estimator are likely 
to be interested in the question: how well does the model
predict? Moreover, in assessing variant models for the same
dependent variable, they are likely to wish to ask: which
model predicts better? Now, the simplest case of comparison 
of models for the same dependent variable is that in which 
one model is a sub-model of the other, or in other words the 
more parsimonious model is obtained by removing one or more 
regressors from the less parsimonious one. If the practitioner
is at all savvy, he or she will... (hmm)

op_predict.inp: contains a function for generating a matrix
 containing various magnitudes arguably relevant to the 
 "predictions" of an ordered probit model
 
discover.inp: script for searching the space of ordered
 probit results (on artificial data) that reveal potentially
 interesting discrepancies.
 
op_test.inp: rig for obtaining detailed results for a case
 considered "interesting" following a run of discover.inp

Results so far (with the caveat that I don't know how general
these are).
