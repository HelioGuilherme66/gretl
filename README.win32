As of version 2017d, it is possible to build gretl for Windows
on MS Windows. We have checked this using MSYS2 and Mingw-w64;
building via cygwin should also be feasible but we have not
tried that.

Look in the win32 subdirectory for sample invocations of gretl's
configure script suitable for use on Windows.
