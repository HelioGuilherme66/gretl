version 1.6.0 for Mac OS X \\[2ex]

\end{center}

\section{Installation}
\label{sec:install}

After downloading the gretl disk image to your desktop, double-click it
to open. Then drag \textsf{Gretl\_Folder} to somewhere suitable on your
system (such as your Applications folder or Desktop).  Once it is in
place you can rename the folder if you wish (\textit{before} running the
program for the first time).

To run gretl, go into \textsf{Gretl\_Folder} and double-click on the
gretl program icon.  You can drag this icon onto the dock if you want
a quick launcher.  

Note: although you may rename the top-level gretl folder, do not move
or rename any components within that folder or the program will break.

\section{System requirements}
\label{sec:os}

This gretl package was built on Mac OS X v10.4.6 (``Tiger'').  I'm not
able to to test it on earlier versions of OS X; it may work on 10.3
but will almost certainly will not work on any Mac operating system
prior to 10.3.

The package requires Apple's version of the X11 window system, which
is available as an optional install from the Tiger distribution DVD.

The package does \textit{not} depend on third-party enhancements for
OS X such as \textsf{Fink}.

\section{Font problems?}
\label{sec:fonts}

If gretl will not start at all, or if it starts but fonts are missing
or font selection doesn't work (you should be able to select fonts
under the ``Preferences'' item on the File menu) try this fix:

\begin{enumerate}
\item Open a Terminal window.
\item Type the command \texttt{sudo fc-cache}
\item Hit the Enter key, then enter the root (admin) password if
  prompted.
\item If you see something like \texttt{fc-cache: not found} then
   X11 is not installed (properly); otherwise the X11 font cache
   should be created/updated.
\item Restart gretl.
\end{enumerate}

\section{Other problems?}

If the AppleScript launcher for gretl doesn't work for you, try
opening an xterm, going into the \textsf{bin} folder of the
gretl package, and executing \textsf{gretl.sh} manually.  That is, do
something like:

\begin{verbatim}
cd Gretl_Folder/bin
./gretl.sh
\end{verbatim}

Hopefully this will give you an informative error message.

\section{Documentation}
\label{sec:doc}

When you start gretl, please consult the program's Help menu for
documentation in various formats.
