>&#13;	<TT
CLASS="application"
>gretl</TT
> offers the idea of a
	<SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"session"</SPAN
> as a way of keeping track of your work
	and revisiting it later. The basic idea is to provide an
	iconic space containing various objects pertaining to your
	current working session (see
      <A
HREF="x593.html#fig-session"
>Figure 3-2</A
>).  You can add objects
	(represented by icons) to this space as you go along.  If you
	save the session, these added objects should be available
	again if you re-open the session later.</P
><P
>&#13;	If you start <TT
CLASS="application"
>gretl</TT
> and open a data
	set, then select <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"Icon view"</SPAN
> from the Session
	menu, you should see the basic default set of icons: these
	give you quick access to the command script
	(<SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"Session"</SPAN
>), information on the data set (if
	any), correlation matrix (<SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"Corrmat"</SPAN
>) and
	descriptive summary statistics (<SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"Summary"</SPAN
>). All
	of these are activated by double-clicking the relevant icon.
	The <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"Data set"</SPAN
> icon is a little more complex:
	double-clicking opens up the data in the built-in spreadsheet,
	but you can also right-click on the icon for a menu of other
	actions.</P

>Once a model or graph is added its icon should appear in
	the Icon View window.  Double-clicking on the icon redisplays
	the object, while right-clicking brings up a menu which lets

	you the option of editing graphs.</P

><P
>&#13;	In econometric research it is common to estimate several
	models with a common dependent variable &#8212; the models
	differing in respect of which independent variables are
	included, or perhaps in respect of the estimator used.  In
	this situation it is convenient to present the regression
	results in the form of a table, where each column contains the
	results (coefficient estimates and standard errors) for a
	given model, and each row contains the estimates for a given
	variable across the models.</P
><P
>&#13;	In the Icon View window <TT
CLASS="application"
>gretl</TT
>
	provides a means of constructing such a table (and copying it
	in plain text, LaTeX or Rich Text Format).  Here is how to do
	it:</P
><P

><LI
><P
>Estimate a model which you wish to include
	      in the table, and in the model display window, under the
	      File menu, select <SPAN

>"Save to session as icon"</SPAN
>
	      or <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"Save as icon and close"</SPAN
>.</P
></LI
><LI
><P
>Repeat step 1 for the other models to be
	      included in the table (up to a total of six
	      models).</P
></LI
><LI
><P
>When you are done estimating the models,
	      open the icon view of your gretl session, by selecting
	      <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"Icon view"</SPAN
> under the Session menu in the
	      main gretl window, or by clicking the <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"session

> icon on the gretl toolbar.</P
></LI
><LI
><P
>In session icon view, there is an icon
	      labeled <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"Model table"</SPAN
>. Decide which model
	      you wish to appear in the left-most column of the model
	      table and add it to the table, either by dragging its
	      icon onto the Model table icon, or by right-clicking on
	      the model icon and selecting <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"Add to model
		table"</SPAN
> from the pop-up menu.</P
></LI
><LI
><P
>Repeat step 4 for the other models you wish
	      to include in the table.  The second model selected will
	      appear in the second column from the left, and so
	      on.</P
></LI
><LI
><P
>When you are finished composing the model
	      table, display it by double-clicking on its icon.  Under
	      the Edit menu in the window which appears, you have the
	      option of copying the table to the clipboard in various
	      formats.</P
