>Creating a data file from scratch</H1
><P
>There are five ways to do this: (1) Find, or create using a
      text editor, a plain text data file and open it with
      <TT
CLASS="application"
>gretl</TT
>'s <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"Import ASCII"</SPAN
>
      option. (2) Use your favorite spreadsheet to establish the data
      file, save it in Comma Separated Values format if necessary
      (this should not be necessary if the spreadsheet program is MS
      Excel or Gnumeric), then use one of
      <TT
CLASS="application"
>gretl</TT
>'s <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"Import"</SPAN
> options
      (CSV, Excel or Gnumeric, as the case may be). (3) Use
      <TT
CLASS="application"
>gretl</TT
>'s built-in spreadsheet. (4)
      Select data series from a suitable database. (5) Use your
      favorite text editor or other software tools to a create data
      file in <TT
CLASS="application"
>gretl</TT
> format
      independently.</P

><P
>Options (1) and (2) involve using
	<TT
CLASS="application"
>gretl</TT
>'s <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"import"</SPAN
>
	mechanism.  For <TT
CLASS="application"
>gretl</TT
> to read such
	data successfully, certain general conditions must be
	satisfied:</P
><P
></P
><UL
><LI
><P
>The first row must contain valid variable names.  A
	    valid variable name is of 8 characters maximum; starts
	    with a letter; and contains nothing but letters, numbers
	    and the underscore character, <TT
CLASS="literal"
>_</TT
>.
	    (Longer variable names will be truncated to 8 characters.)
	    Qualifications to the above:  First, in the case of an
	    ASCII or CSV import, if the file contains no row with
	    variable names the program will automatically add names,
	    <TT
CLASS="varname"
>v1</TT
>, <TT
CLASS="varname"
>v2</TT
> and so on.
	    Second, by <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"the first row"</SPAN
> is meant the first
	    <SPAN
CLASS="emphasis"
><I
CLASS="emphasis"
>relevant</I
></SPAN
> row.  In the case of ASCII
	    and CSV imports, blank rows and rows beginning with a hash
	    mark, <TT
CLASS="literal"
>#</TT
>, are ignored.  In the case of
	    Excel and Gnumeric imports, you are presented with a
	    dialog box where you can select an offset into the
	    spreadsheet, so that <TT
CLASS="application"
>gretl</TT
> will
	    ignore a specified number of rows and/or columns.
	  </P
></LI
><LI
><P
>Data values: these should constitute a rectangular
	    block, with one variable per column (and one observation
	    per row).  The number of variables (data columns) must
	    match the number of variable names given. See also
	    <A

CLASS="emphasis"
><I

> column may contain strings such
	    as dates, or labels for cross-sectional observations.
	    Such strings have a maximum of 8 characters (as with
	    variable names, longer strings will be truncated).  A
	    column of this sort should be headed with the string
	    <TT
CLASS="literal"

CLASS="literal"
>date</TT
>, or the
	    first row entry may be left blank.</P
><P
>For dates to be recognized as such, the date strings
	    must adhere to one or other of a set of specific formats,
	    as follows.  For <SPAN

><I
CLASS="emphasis"
>annual</I
></SPAN
> data: 4-digit
	    years.  For <SPAN
CLASS="emphasis"
><I
CLASS="emphasis"

></SPAN

	    year, followed by a separator (either a period, a colon,
	    or the letter <TT
CLASS="literal"
>Q</TT
>), followed by a 1-digit
	    quarter.  Examples: <TT
CLASS="literal"
>1997.1</TT
>,
	    <TT
CLASS="literal"
>2002:3</TT

CLASS="literal"
>1947Q1</TT

	    <SPAN
CLASS="emphasis"
><I
CLASS="emphasis"
>monthly</I
></SPAN
> data: a 4-digit year,
	    followed by a period or a colon, followed by a two-digit
	    month.  Examples: <TT
CLASS="literal"
>1997.01</TT
>,
	    <TT
CLASS="literal"
>2002:10</TT

><P
>CSV files can use comma, space or tab as the column
	separator.  When you use the <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"Import CSV"</SPAN
> menu
	item you are prompted to specify the separator.  In the case
	of <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"

	data series of relatively high frequency (e.g. monthly) to a

	different frequencies from a database into
	<TT
