>Appendix D. Advanced econometric analysis
    with free software</H1
><P
>As mentioned in the main text,
    <TT
CLASS="application"
>gretl</TT
> offers a reasonably full
    selection of least-squares based estimators, plus a few additional
    estimators such as (binomial) logit and probit and Least Absolute
    Deviations. Advanced users may, however, find
    <TT
CLASS="application"
>gretl</TT
>'s menu of statistical routines
    restrictive.</P
><P
>No doubt some advanced users will prefer to write their own
    statistical code in a fundamental computer language such as C, C++
    or Fortran.  Another option is to use a relatively high-level
    language that offers easy matrix manipulation and that already has
    numerous statistical routines built in, or available as add-on
    packages. If the latter option sounds attractive, and you are
    interested in using free, open source software, I would recommend
    taking a look at either GNU R (<A
HREF="http://www.r-project.org/"
TARGET="_top"
>r-project.org</A
>) or
    (<A
HREF="http://www.octave.org/"
TARGET="_top"
>GNU Octave</A
>). These
    programs are very close to the commercial programs S and Matlab
    respectively. 
  </P
><P
>&#13;    Also as mentioned above, <TT
CLASS="application"
>gretl</TT
> offers
    the facility of exporting data in the formats of both Octave and
    R.  In the case of Octave, the <TT
CLASS="application"
>gretl</TT
>
    data set is saved thus: the first variable listed for export is
    treated as the dependent variable and is saved as a vector,
    <TT
CLASS="varname"
>y</TT
>, while the remaining variables are saved
    jointly as a matrix, <TT
CLASS="varname"
>X</TT
>. You can pull the
    <TT
CLASS="varname"
>X</TT
> matrix apart if you wish, once the data are
    loaded in Octave. See the Octave manual for details. As for R, the
    exported data file preserves any time series structure that is
    apparent to <TT
CLASS="application"
>gretl</TT
>. The series are saved
    as individual structures. The data should be brought into R using
    the <TT
CLASS="command"
>source()</TT
> command.
  </P
><P
>&#13;    Of these two programs, R is perhaps more likely to be of immediate
    interest to econometricians since it offers more in the way of
    statistical routines (e.g. generalized linear models, maximum
    likelihood estimation, time series methods). I have therefore
    supplied <TT
CLASS="application"
>gretl</TT
> with a convenience
    function for moving data quickly into R. Under
    <TT
CLASS="application"
>gretl</TT
>'s Session menu, you will find the
    entry <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"Start GNU R"</SPAN
>.  This writes out an R version of
    the current <TT
CLASS="application"
>gretl</TT
> data set
    (<TT
CLASS="filename"
>Rdata.tmp</TT
>, in the user's gretl directory),
    and sources it into a new R session. A few details on this follow.
  </P
><P
>&#13;    First, the data are brought into R by writing a temporary version
    of <TT
CLASS="filename"
>.Rprofile</TT
> in the current working
    directory.  (If such a file exists it is referenced by R at
    startup.)  In case you already have a personal
    <TT
CLASS="filename"
>.Rprofile</TT
> in place, the original file is
    temporarily moved to <TT
CLASS="filename"
>.Rprofile.gretltmp</TT
>, and
    on exit from <TT
CLASS="application"
>gretl</TT
> it is restored.  (If
    anyone can suggest a cleaner way of doing this I'd be happy to
    hear of it.)
  </P
><P
>&#13;    Second, the particular way R is invoked depends on the internal
    <TT
CLASS="application"
>gretl</TT
> variable
    <TT
CLASS="varname"
>Rcommand</TT
>, whose value may be set under the
    File, Preferences menu.  The default command is
    <TT
CLASS="command"
>RGui.exe</TT
> under MS Windows. Under X it is either
    <TT
CLASS="command"
>R --gui=gnome</TT
> if an installation of the Gnome
    desktop (<A
HREF="http://www.gnome.org/"
TARGET="_top"
>gnome.org</A
>) was
    detected at compile time, or <TT
CLASS="command"
>xterm -e R</TT
> if
    Gnome was not found. Please note that at most three
    space-separated elements in this command string will be processed;
    any extra elements are ignored.
