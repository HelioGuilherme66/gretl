>Boxplots are not generated using gnuplot, but rather by
	<TT
CLASS="application"
>gretl</TT
> itself.</P
><P
>These plots (after Tukey and Chambers) display the
	distribution of a variable. The central box encloses the
	middle 50 percent of the data, i.e. it is bounded by the first
	and third quartiles.  The <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"whiskers"</SPAN
> extend to
	the minimum and maximum values.  A line is drawn across the
	box at the median.</P
><P
>In the case of notched boxes, the notch shows the limits
	of an approximate 90 percent confidence interval.  This is
	obtained by the bootstrap method, which can take a while if
	the data series is very long.</P
><P
>Clicking the mouse in the boxplots window brings up a menu
	which enables you to save the plots as encapsulated postscript
	(EPS) or as a full-page postscript file.  Under the X window
	system you can also save the window as an XPM file; under MS
	Windows you can copy it to the clipboard as a bitmap.  The
	menu also gives you the option of opening a summary window
	which displays five-number summaries (minimum, first quartile,
	median, third quartile, maxmimum), plus a confidence interval
	for the median if the <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"notched"</SPAN
> option was
	chosen.
      </P
><P
>Some details of gretl's boxplots can be controlled via a
	(plain text) file named <TT
CLASS="filename"
>.boxplotrc</TT
> which
	is looked for, in turn, in the current working directory, the
	user's home directory (corresponding to the environment
	variable <TT
CLASS="envar"
>HOME</TT
>) and the gretl user directory
	(which is displayed and may be changed under the <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"File,
	  Preferences, General"</SPAN
> menu).  Options that can be set
	in this way are the font to use when producing postscript
	output (must be a valid generic postscript font name; the
	default is Helvetica), the size of the font in points (also
	for postscript output; default is 12), the minimum and maximum
	for the y-axis range, the width and height of the plot in
	pixels (default, 560 x 448), whether numerical values should
	be printed for the quartiles and median (default, don't print
	them), and whether outliers (points lying beyond 1.5 times the
	interquartile range from the central box) should be indicated
	separately (default, no).  Here is an example:</P
><PRE
CLASS="programlisting"
>&#13;font = Times-Roman
fontsize = 16
max = 4.0
min = 0
width = 400
height = 448
numbers = %3.2f
outliers = true
      </PRE
><P
>On the second to last line, the value associated with
	<TT
CLASS="literal"
>numbers</TT
> is a <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"printf"</SPAN
> format
	string as in the C programming language; if specified, this
	controls the printing of the median and quartiles next to the
	boxplot, if no <TT
CLASS="literal"
>numbers</TT
> entry is given these
	values are not printed.  In the example, the values will be
	printed to a width of 3 digits, with 2 digits of precision
	following the decimal point.</P
><P
>Not all of the options need be specified, and the order
	doesn't matter.  Lines not matching the pattern <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"key =
	  value"</SPAN
> are ignored, as are lines that begin with the
	hash mark, <TT
CLASS="literal"
>#</TT
>.</P
><P
>After each variable specified in the boxplot command, a
	parenthesized boolean expression may be added, to limit the
	sample for the variable in question.  A space must be inserted
	between the variable name or number and the expression.
	Suppose you have salary figures for men and women, and you
	have a dummy variable <TT
CLASS="literal"
>GENDER</TT
> with value 1
	for men and 0 for women.  In that case you could draw
	comparative boxplots with the following line in the boxplots
	dialog:</P
><PRE
CLASS="programlisting"
>&#13;      salary (GENDER=1) salary (GENDER=0)
      </PRE
