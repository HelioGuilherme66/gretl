><P
>Having come this far, we can reveal that there is a special
      purpose estimation command for use with panel data, the
      <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"Pooled OLS"</SPAN
> option under the
      <SPAN
CLASS="guimenu"
>Model</SPAN
> menu. This command is available only if
      the data set is recognized as a panel.  To take advantage of it,
      you should specify a model without any dummy variables
      representing cross-sectional units.  The routine presents
      estimates for straightforward pooled OLS, which treats
      cross-sectional and time-series variation at par.  This model
      may or may not be appropriate.  Under the
      <SPAN
CLASS="guimenu"
>Tests</SPAN
> menu in the model window, you will find
      an item <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"panel diagnostics"</SPAN
>, which tests pooled OLS
      against the principal alternatives, the fixed effects and random
      effects models.</P
><P
>The fixed effects model adds a dummy variable for all but
      one of the cross-sectional units, allowing the intercept of the
      regression to vary across the units.  An
      <SPAN
CLASS="emphasis"
><I
CLASS="emphasis"
>F</I
></SPAN
>-test for the joint significance of these
      dummies is presented: if the p-value for this test is small,
      that counts against the null hypothesis (that the simple pooled
      model is adequate) and in favor of the fixed effects
      model.</P
><P
>The random effects model, on the other hand, decomposes the
      residual variance into two parts, one part specific to the
      cross-sectional unit or <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"group"</SPAN
> and the other
      specific to the particular observation.  (This estimator can be
      computed only if the panel is <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"wide"</SPAN
> enough, that
      is, if the number of cross-sectional units in the data set
      exceeds the number of parameters to be estimated.)  The
      Breusch&#8211;Pagan LM statistic tests the null hypothesis
      (again, that the pooled OLS estimator is adequate) against the
      random effects alternative.</P
><P
>It is quite possible that the pooled OLS model is rejected
      against both of the alternatives, fixed effects and random
      effects. How, then, to assess the relative merits of the two
      alternative estimators?  The Hausman test (also reported,
      provided the random effects model can be estimated) addresses
      this issue.  Provided the unit- or group-specific error is
      uncorrelated with the independent variables, the random effects
      estimator is more efficient than the fixed effects estimator;
      otherwise the random effects estimator is inconsistent, in which
      case the fixed effects estimator is to be preferred.  The null
      hypothesis for the Hausman test is that the group-specific error
      is not so correlated (and therefore the random effects model is
      preferable).  Thus a low p-value for this tests counts against
      the random effects model and in favor of fixed effects.</P
