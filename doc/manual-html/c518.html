><P
>&#13;      As you execute commands in <TT
CLASS="application"
>gretl</TT
>,
      using the GUI and filling in dialog entries, those commands are
      recorded in the form of a <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"script"</SPAN
> or batch file.
      Such scripts can be edited and re-run, using either
      <TT
CLASS="application"
>gretl</TT
> or the command-line client,
      <TT
CLASS="application"
>gretlcli</TT
>.</P
><P
>&#13;      To view the current state of the script at any point in a
      <TT
CLASS="application"
>gretl</TT
> session, choose <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"View
	command log"</SPAN
> under the File menu. This log file is
      called <TT
CLASS="filename"
>session.inp</TT
> and it is overwritten
      whenever you start a new session.  To preserve it, save the
      script under a different name.  Script files will be found most
      easily, using the GUI file selector, if you name them with the
      extension <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"<TT
CLASS="filename"
>.inp</TT
>"</SPAN
>.</P
><P
>To open a script you have written independently, use the
      <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"File, Open command file"</SPAN
> menu item; to create a
      script from scratch use the <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"File, New command
	file"</SPAN
> item or the <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"new script"</SPAN
> toolbar
      button.  In either case a script window will open (see <A
HREF="c518.html#fig-scriptwin"

>The toolbar at the top of the script window offers the
      following functions (left to right): (1) Save the file; (2) Save
      the file under a specified name; (3) Print the file (under
      Windows or the gnome desktop only); (4) Execute the commands in
      the file; (5) Copy selected text; (6) Paste the selected text;
      (7) Find and replace text; (8) Undo the last Paste or Replace
      action; (9) Help (if you place the cursor in a command word and
      press the question mark you will get help on that command); (10)
      Close the window.
    </P

>When you click the Execute icon or choose the <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"File,
	Run"</SPAN
> menu item all output is directed to a single
      window, where it can be edited, saved or copied to the
      clipboard.
    </P
><P
>To learn more about the possibilities of scripting, take a
      look at the <TT
CLASS="application"
>gretl</TT
> Help item
      <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"Script commands syntax,"</SPAN
> or start up the
      command-line program <TT
CLASS="application"
>gretlcli</TT
> and
      consult its help, or consult <A
HREF="c1685.html"
>Chapter 10</A
> in this
      manual. In addition, the <TT
CLASS="application"
>gretl</TT
>
      package includes over 70 <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"practice"</SPAN
> scripts.  Most
      of these relate to Ramanathan (2002), but they may also be used
      as a free-standing introduction to scripting in
      <TT
CLASS="application"
>gretl</TT
> and to various points of
      econometric theory.  You can explore the practice files under
      <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"File, Open command file, practice file"</SPAN
>  There you
      will find a listing of the files along with a brief description
      of the points they illustrate and the data they employ.  Open
      any file and run it to see the output.
    </P
><P
>Note that long commands in a script can be broken over two
      or more lines, using backslash as a continuation
      character.</P
><P
>You can, if you wish, use the GUI controls and the scripting
      approach in tandem, exploiting each method where it offers
      greater convenience.  Here are two suggestions.</P
><P
></P
><UL
><LI
><P
>Open a data file in the GUI.  Explore the data
	  &#8212; generate graphs, run regressions, perform tests.
	  Then open the Command log, edit out any redundant commands,
	  and save it under a specific name. Run the script to
	  generate a single file containing a concise record of your
	  work.</P
></LI
><LI
><P
>Start by establishing a new script file.  Type
	  in any commands that may be required to set up
	  transformations of the data (see the <TT
CLASS="command"
>genr</TT
>
	  command in <A
HREF="c1685.html"
>Chapter 10</A
> below). Typically this
	  sort of thing can be accomplished more efficiently via
	  commands assembled with forethought rather than
	  point-and-click. Then save and run the script: the GUI data
	  window will be updated accordingly. Now you can carry out
	  further exploration of the data via the GUI. To revisit the
	  data at a later point, open and rerun the
	  <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"preparatory"</SPAN
> script first.</P
></LI
></UL
><P
>When you estimate a model using point-and-click, the model
      results are displayed in a separate window, offering menus which
      let you perform tests, draw graphs, save data from the model,
      and so on.  Ordinarily, when you estimate a model using a script
      you just get a non-interactive printout of the results.  You
      can, however, arrange for models estimated in a script to be
      <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"captured"</SPAN
>, so that you can examine them
      interactively when the script is finished.  Here is an example
      of the syntax for achieving this effect:
    </P
><PRE
CLASS="programlisting"
>&#13;      Model1 &#60;- ols Ct 0 Yt</PRE
><P
>That is, you type a name for the model to be saved under,
    then a back-pointing <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"assignment arrow"</SPAN
>, then
    the model command.  You may use names that have embedded spaces
    if you like, but such names must always be wrapped in double
    quotes:</P
><PRE
CLASS="programlisting"
>&#13;      "Model 1" &#60;- ols Ct 0 Yt</PRE
><P
>Models saved in this way will appear as icons in the
      <TT
CLASS="application"
>gretl</TT
> session window (see <A
HREF="x593.html"
>the Section called <I
>The <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"session"</SPAN
>
      concept</I
></A
>) after the script is executed.  In
      addition, you can arrange to have a named model displayed (in
      its own window) automatically as follows:</P
><PRE
CLASS="programlisting"
>&#13;      Model1.show</PRE
><P
>Again, if the name contains spaces it must be
      quoted:</P
><PRE
CLASS="programlisting"
>&#13;      "Model 1".show</PRE
><P
>The same commands can be used for graphs.  For example the
    following will create a plot of <TT
CLASS="varname"
>Ct</TT
> against
    <TT
CLASS="varname"
>Yt</TT
>, save it under the name
    <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"CrossPlot"</SPAN
>, and have it displayed:</P
><PRE
CLASS="programlisting"
>&#13;      CrossPlot &#60;- gnuplot Ct Yt
      CrossPlot.show</PRE
