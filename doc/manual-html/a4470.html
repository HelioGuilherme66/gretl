    equations of Least Squares are by default solved via Cholesky
    decomposition, which is accurate enough for most purposes (with
    the option of using QR decomposition instead).  The program has
    been tested rather thoroughly on the statistical reference
    datasets provided by NIST (the U.S. National Institute of
    Standards and Technology) and a full account of the results may be
    found on the gretl website (follow the link <SPAN

	<TT

	to more accurate probability distribution code.</P

><P
>The reviewers noted a flaw in the presentation of
	regression coefficients in <TT
CLASS="application"
>gretl</TT

	whereby some coefficients could be printed to an unacceptably
	small number of significant figures. This was fixed in version
	0.999 (released August 25, 2002): now all the statistics
	associated with a regression are printed to 6 significant
	figures.</P

>It transpired from the reviewer's tests that the
	numerical accuracy of <TT
CLASS="application"
>gretl</TT
> on MS
	Windows was less than on Linux, where I had done my testing.
	For example, on the Longley data &#8212; a well-known
	<SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"ill-conditioned"</SPAN
> dataset often used for testing
	econometrics programs &#8212; the Windows version of gretl was
	getting some coefficients wrong at the 7th digit while the
	same coefficients were correct on Linux.  This anomaly was
	fixed in <TT
CLASS="application"
>gretl</TT
> version 1.0pre3
	(released October 10, 2002).</P

>The current version of the <TT
CLASS="application"
>gretl</TT
>
    source code package contains a <TT
CLASS="filename"
>tests</TT
>
    subdirectory, with a test suite based on the NIST datasets.  This
    is invoked if you do <TT
CLASS="command"
>make check</TT
> in the top
    source directory.  You are warned if the numerical accuracy falls
    short of standard.  Please consult the file
    <TT
CLASS="filename"
>README</TT
> in the <TT
CLASS="filename"
>tests</TT
>
    directory for details.</P
><P
>The NIST test suite is also distributed with the MS Windows
    version of <TT
CLASS="application"
>gretl</TT
>.  You can run the
    tests by invoking the program
    <TT
CLASS="filename"
>nisttest.exe</TT
>.</P
><P
>As mentioned above, all regression statistics are printed to 6
    significant figures in the current version of
    <TT
CLASS="application"
>gretl</TT
> (except when the
    multiple-precision plugin is used, then results are given to 12
    figures).  If you want to examine a particular value more closely,
    first save it (see <A
HREF="x1725.html#genr"
>the Section called <I
>genr</I
> in Chapter 10</A
>) then print it using 
    <TT
CLASS="command"
>print -t</TT
> (see <A
HREF="c1685.html"
>Chapter 10</A
>).  This
    will show the value to 10 digits.</P
