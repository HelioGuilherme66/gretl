\section{Panel structure}
\label{panel-structure}

Panel data are inherently three dimensional --- the
      dimensions being variable, cross-sectional unit, and
      time-period.  For representation in a textual computer file (and
      also for gretl's internal calculations) these three dimensions
      must somehow be flattened into two.  This
      ``flattening'' involves taking layers of the data
      that would naturally stack in a third dimension, and stacking
      them in the vertical dimension.\app{Gretl} always expects data to be
      arranged ``by observation'', that is, such that each
      row represents an observation (and each variable occupies one
      and only one column).  In this context the flattening of a panel
      data set can be done in either of two ways:
\begin{itemize}
\item 
	  Stacked cross-sections: the successive vertical blocks each
	  comprise a cross-section for a given period.
\item 
	  Stacked time-series: the successive vertical blocks each
	  comprise a time series for a given cross-sectional
	  unit.
\end{itemize}

You may use whichever arrangement is more convenient. Under
      \app{gretl}'s \textsf{Sample}
      menu you will find an item ``Restructure panel''
      which allows you to convert from stacked cross section form to
      stacked time series or vice versa.When you import panel data into
      \app{gretl} from a spreadsheet or comma
      separated format, the panel nature of the data will not be
      recognized automatically (most likely the data will be treated
      as ``undated'').  A panel interpretation can be
      imposed on the data in either of two ways.
\begin{enumerate}
\item Use the  GUI menu item ``Sample, Dataset
	    structure''.  In the first dialog box that appears,
	  select ``Panel''.  In the next dialog, make a
	  selection between stacked time series or stacked cross
	  sections depending on how your data are organized.  In the
	  next, supply the number of cross-sectional units in the
	  dataset.  Finally, check the specification that is shown to
	  you, and confirm the change if it looks OK.
	
\item Use the script command \cmd{setobs}.  For
	  panel data this command takes the form
	  \verb+setobs+ freq
	  \verb+1:1+ structure,
	  where freq is replaced by the
	  ``block size'' of the data (that is, the number
	  of periods in the case of stacked time series, or the number
	  of cross-sectional units in the case of stacked
	  cross-sections) and structure is
	  either \verb+--stacked-time-series+ or
	  \verb+--stacked-cross-section+.  Two examples
	  are given below: the first is suitable for a panel in the
	  form of stacked time series with observations from 20
	  periods; the second for stacked cross sections with 5
	  cross-sectional units.   
	
\begin{verbatim}
	    setobs 20 1:1 --stacked-time-series
	    setobs 5 1:1 --stacked-cross-section
	\end{verbatim}

\end{enumerate}



\section{Dummy variables}
\label{dummies}

In a panel study you may wish to construct dummy variables
      of one or both of the following sorts: (a) dummies as unique
      identifiers for the cross-sectional units, and (b) dummies as
      unique identifiers for the time periods.  The former may be used
      to allow the intercept of the regression to differ across the
      units, the latter to allow the intercept to differ across
      periods.Three special functions are available to create such dummies.
      These are found under the ``Data, Add variables''
      menu in the GUI, or under the \cmd{genr} command in
      script mode or \app{gretlcli}.
\begin{enumerate}
\item ``periodic dummies'' (script command
	  \cmd{genr dummy}).  This command creates a set
	  of dummy variables identifying the periods.  The variable
	  \verb+dummy_1+ will have value 1 in each row
	  corresponding to a period 1 observation, 0 otherwise;
	  \verb+dummy_2+ will have value 1 in each row
	  corresponding to a period 2 observation, 0 otherwise; and so
	  on.
\item ``unit dummies'' (script command
	  \cmd{genr unitdum}).  This command creates a
	  set of dummy variables identifying the cross-sectional
	  units.  The variable \verb+du_1+ will have value
	  1 in each row corresponding to a unit 1 observation, 0
	  otherwise; \verb+du_2+ will have value 1 in each
	  row corresponding to a unit 2 observation, 0 otherwise; and
	  so on.
\item ``panel dummies'' (script command
	  \cmd{genr paneldum}).  This creates both period
	  and unit dummy variables. The unit dummies are named
	  \verb+du_1+, \verb+du_2+ and so on,
	  while the period dummies are named \verb+dt_1+,
	  \verb+dt_2+, etc.
\end{enumerate}

If a panel data set has the \verb+YEAR+ of the
      observation entered as one of the variables you can create a
      periodic dummy to pick out a particular year, e.g. \cmd{genr
	dum = (YEAR=1960)}.  You can also create periodic
      dummy variables using the modulus operator,
      \verb+%+.  For instance, to create a dummy with
      value 1 for the first observation and every thirtieth
      observation thereafter, 0 otherwise, do
\begin{verbatim}
      genr index 
      genr dum = ((index-1)%30) = 0
    \end{verbatim}


\section{Lags and differences with panel
      data}
\label{panel-lagged}

If the time periods are evenly spaced you may want to use
      lagged values of variables in a panel regression; you may also
      with to construct first differences of variables of
      interest.Once a dataset is properly identified as a panel (as
      described in the previous section),
      \app{gretl} will handle the generation of
      such variables correctly.  For example the command 
      \verb+genr x1_1 = x1(-1)+ will create a variable that contains
      the first lag of \verb+x1+ where available, and the
      missing value code where the lag is not available.
    When you run a regression using such variables, the program
      will automatically skip the missing observations.

\section{Pooled estimation}
\label{pooled-est}

There is a special purpose estimation command for use with
      panel data, the ``Pooled OLS'' option under the
      \textsf{Model} menu. This command is available only if
      the data set is recognized as a panel.  To take advantage of it,
      you should specify a model without any dummy variables
      representing cross-sectional units.  The routine presents
      estimates for straightforward pooled OLS, which treats
      cross-sectional and time-series variation at par.  This model
      may or may not be appropriate.  Under the
      \textsf{Tests} menu in the model window, you will find
      an item ``panel diagnostics'', which tests pooled OLS
      against the principal alternatives, the fixed effects and random
      effects models.The fixed effects model adds a dummy variable for all but
      one of the cross-sectional units, allowing the intercept of the
      regression to vary across the units.  An
      \emph{F}-test for the joint significance of these
      dummies is presented: if the p-value for this test is small,
      that counts against the null hypothesis (that the simple pooled
      model is adequate) and in favor of the fixed effects
      model.The random effects model, on the other hand, decomposes the
      residual variance into two parts, one part specific to the
      cross-sectional unit or ``group'' and the other
      specific to the particular observation.  (This estimator can be
      computed only if the panel is ``wide'' enough, that
      is, if the number of cross-sectional units in the data set
      exceeds the number of parameters to be estimated.)  The
      Breusch--Pagan LM statistic tests the null hypothesis
      (again, that the pooled OLS estimator is adequate) against the
      random effects alternative.It is quite possible that the pooled OLS model is rejected
      against both of the alternatives, fixed effects and random
      effects. How, then, to assess the relative merits of the two
      alternative estimators?  The Hausman test (also reported,
      provided the random effects model can be estimated) addresses
      this issue.  Provided the unit- or group-specific error is
      uncorrelated with the independent variables, the random effects
      estimator is more efficient than the fixed effects estimator;
      otherwise the random effects estimator is inconsistent, in which
      case the fixed effects estimator is to be preferred.  The null
      hypothesis for the Hausman test is that the group-specific error
      is not so correlated (and therefore the random effects model is
      preferable).  Thus a low p-value for this tests counts against
      the random effects model and in favor of fixed effects.For a rigorous discussion of this topic, see Greene (2000),
      chapter 14.

\section{Illustration: the Penn World Table}
\label{PWT}

The Penn World Table (homepage at \href{http://pwt.econ.upenn.edu/}{pwt.econ.upenn.edu})
      is a rich macroeconomic panel dataset, spanning 152 countries
      over the years 1950--1992.  The data are available in
      \app{gretl} format; please see the
      \app{gretl} \href{http://gretl.sourceforge.net/gretl_data.html}{data
	site} (this is a free download, although it is not
      included in the main \app{gretl}
      package).Example \ref{examp-pwt} below opens
      \verb+pwt56_60_89.gdt+, a subset of the pwt
      containing data on 120 countries, 1960--89, for 20
      variables, with no missing observations (the full data set,
      which is also supplied in the pwt package for
      \app{gretl}, has many missing
      observations). Total growth of real GDP, 1960--89, is
      calculated for each country and regressed against the 1960 level
      of real GDP, to see if there is evidence for
      ``convergence'' (i.e. faster growth on the part of
      countries starting from a low base).
