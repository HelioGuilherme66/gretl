\chapter{Multivariate models}
\label{chap:system}

By a multivariate model we mean one that includes more than one
dependent variable. Certain specific types of multivariate model for
time-series data are discussed elsewhere: chapter~\ref{chap:var} deals
with VARs and chapter~\ref{chap:vecm} with VECMs. Here we discuss two
general sorts of multivariate model, implemented in \app{gretl} via
the \cmd{system} command: SUR systems (Seemingly Unrelated
Regressions), in which all the regressors are taken to be exogenous
and interest centers on the covariance of the error term across
equations; and simultaneous systems, in which some regressors are
assumed to be endogenous.

We begin with an account of the syntax and use of the \cmd{system}
command in its regular form (along with its companions
\texttt{restrict} and \texttt{estimate}); we then describe some
extensions of this command that may be useful for people writing
functions.

\section{The system command}
\label{sec:system-regular}

The specification of a multivariate system takes the form of a block
of statements, starting with \texttt{system} and ending with
\texttt{end system}. 

\subsection{Starting a system block}

The first line may be augmented in either of two ways (but see also
section~\ref{sec:system-functions} below):

\begin{itemize}
\item An estimation method is specified for the system. This is done
  by following \texttt{system} with an expression of the form
  \texttt{method=}\textsl{estimator}, where \textsl{estimator} must be
  one of \texttt{ols} (Ordinary Least Squares), \texttt{tsls}
  (Two-Stage Least Squares), \texttt{sur} (Seemingly Unrelated
  Regressions), \texttt{3sls} (Three-Stage Least Squares),
  \texttt{liml} (Limited Information Maximum Likelihood) or
  \texttt{fiml} (Full Information Maximum Likelihood). Two examples:
\begin{code}
system method=sur
system method=fiml
\end{code}
OLS, TSLS and LIML are, of course, single-equation methods rather than
true system estimators; they are included to facilitate comparisons.
\item The system is assigned a name. This is done by giving the name
  first, followed by a back-arrow, ``\verb|<-|'', followed by
  \texttt{system}.  If the name contains spaces it must be enclosed in
  double-quotes. Here are two examples:
\begin{code}
sys1 <- system
"System 1" <- system
\end{code}
\end{itemize}

If the initial \texttt{system} line is augmented in the first way, the
effect is that the following system is estimated as soon as its
specification is completed. The effect of the second formulation is
that the system is defined and saved, but it is not estimated until an
\texttt{estimate} command is executed. These two possibilities can be
combined, as in
\begin{code}
mysys <- system method=3sls
\end{code}
in which case the system is estimated immediately, via the specified
method, but is also available under the specified name for use with
further invocations of \texttt{restrict} and \texttt{estimate}.

\subsection{The body of a system block}

The most basic element in the body of a \texttt{system} block is the
\texttt{equation} statement, which is used to specify each equation
within the system. This takes the same form as the regression
specification for single-equation estimators, namely a list of series
with the dependent variable given first, followed by the regressors,
with the series given either by name or by ID number (order in the
dataset). A system block must contain at least two \texttt{equation}
statements, and for systems without endogenous regressors these
statements are all that is required. So, for example, a minimal
SUR specification might look like this:

\begin{code}
system method=sur
  equation y1 const x1
  equation y2 const x2
end system
\end{code}

For simultaneous systems it is necessary to determine which regressors
are endogenous and which exogenous. By default all regressors are
treated as exogenous, except that any variable that appears as the
dependent variable in one equation is automatically treated as
endogeous if it appears as a regressor elsewhere. However, an explicit
list of endogenous regressors may be supplied following the
\texttt{equations} lines: this takes the form of the keyword
\texttt{endog} followed by the names or ID numbers of the relevant
regressors.

When estimation is via TSLS or 3SLS it is possible to specify a
particular set of instruments for each equation. This is done by
giving the \texttt{equation} lists in the format used with the
\texttt{tsls} command: first the dependent variable, then the
regressors, then a semicolon, then the instruments, as in

\begin{code}
system method=3sls
  equation y1 const x11 x12 ; const x11 z1
  equation y2 const x21 x22 ; const x21 z2
end system
\end{code}

In this case, as in \texttt{tsls}, any regressors that are not also
listed as instruments are treated as endogenous, so in the example
above \texttt{x11} and \texttt{x21} are treated as exogenous while
\texttt{x21} and \texttt{x22} are endogenous, and instrumented by
\texttt{z1} and \texttt{z2} respectively.

One more sort of statement is allowed in a \texttt{system} block:
that is, the keyword \texttt{identity} followed by an equation 
in terms of pre-defined series: this is specific to estimation
via FIML, and defines an accounting relationship, rather then a
stochastic one, between series.

\section{Extensions for use in functions}
\label{sec:system-functions}

It is also possible to define a multivariate system in a programmatic
way. This is useful if the precise specification of the system depends
on some input parameters that are not known in advance, but are given
when the script is actually run. (This feature was added in version
1.9.7 of \app{gretl}.)

The relevant syntax is given by the \texttt{equations} keyword (note
the plural), which replaces the block of \texttt{equation} lines in
the standard form. An \texttt{equations} line requires two list
arguments. The first list must contain all series on the left-hand
side of the system; thus the number of elements in this first list
determines the number of equations in the system. The second list is a
``list of lists'', which is a special variant of the list data type.
That is, for each equation of the system you must provide a list of
right-hand side variables, and the lists for all equations must be
joined by assigning them to another list object; in that assignment,
they must be separated by a semicolon.  Here is an example for a
two-equation system:

\begin{code}
list syslist = xlist1 ; xlist2
\end{code}

Therefore, specifying a system generically in this way just involves 
building the necessary list arguments, as shown in the following
example:

\begin{code}
open denmark
list LHS = LRM LRY
list RHS1 = const LRM(-1) IBO(-1) IDE(-1)
list RHS2 = const LRY(-1) IBO(-1)
list RHS = RHS1 ; RHS2
system method=ols
     equations LHS RHS
end system
\end{code}

Another issue when programming a multi-equation system in a flexible
way is how to save and reuse a system specification inside a function.
(You cannot use the \verb|<-| name assignment syntax there, because
that would alter the session icon view, and that is not allowed from
inside functions.) Instead you simply have to omit the
``\texttt{method=}\textsl{estimator}'' specifier from the
\texttt{system} line. Then the \texttt{system} block creates an
anonymous system which you can afterwards address with the
\texttt{estimate} and \texttt{restrict} commands by using the
\verb|$system| accessor. Only the system which was specified last can
be accessed in this way. For example:

\begin{code}
function void anonsys(series x, series y)
     system
         equation x const
         equation y const
     end system
     estimate $system method=ols
     estimate $system method=sur
     restrict $system
         b[1,1]=1
     end restrict
     estimate $system method=ols
end function

open denmark
anonsys(LRY,LRM)
\end{code}
