\section{Introduction}
\label{cmd-intro}

The commands defined below may be executed interactively in the
command-line client program or in the console window of the GUI
program.  They may also be placed in a ``script'' or batch file for
non-interactive execution.
    
The following notational conventions are used below:
    
\begin{itemize}

\item A \texttt{typewriter font} is used for material that you would
  type directly, and also for internal names of variables.

\item Terms in a \textsl{slanted font} are place-holders: you should
  substitute some specific replacement.  For example, you might type
  \texttt{income} in place of the generic \textsl{xvar}.

\item The construction \texttt{[} \textsl{arg} \texttt{]} means that
  the argument \textsl{arg} is optional: you may supply it or not (but
  in any case don't type the brackets).

\item The phrase ``estimation command'' means a command that generates
  estimates for a given model, for example \cmd{ols}, \cmd{ar} or
  \cmd{wls}.

\end{itemize}
