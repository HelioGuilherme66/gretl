\section{Introduction}
\label{Python-intro}

According to \url{www.python.org}, \app{Python} is ``an easy to learn,
powerful programming language. It has efficient high-level data
structures and a simple but effective approach to object-oriented
programming. Python's elegant syntax and dynamic typing, together with
its interpreted nature, make it an ideal language for scripting and
rapid application development in many areas on most platforms.''

Indeed, \app{Python} is widely used in a great variety of
contexts. Numerous add-on modules are available; the ones likely to be
of greatest interest to econometricians include \app{NumPy} (``the
fundamental package for scientific computing with Python'' --- see
\url{www.numpy.org}); \app{SciPy} (which builds on \app{NumPy} --- see
\url{www.scipy.org}); and \app{Statsmodels}
(\url{http://statsmodels.sourceforge.net/}).

\section{Python support in gretl}
\label{sec:Python-support}

The support offered for \app{Python} in \app{gretl} is similar to that
offered for \app{Octave} (chapter~\ref{chap:gretlOctave}). You can
open and edit \app{Python} scripts in the \app{gretl} GUI.  Clicking
the ``execute'' icon in the editor window will send your code to
\app{Python} for execution. In addition you can embed \app{Python}
code within a \app{gretl} script using a \texttt{foreign} block, as
described in connection with \app{R}.

When you launch \app{Python} from within \app{gretl} one variable and
two convenience functions are pre-defined, as follows.
\begin{code}
gretl_dotdir
gretl_loadmat(filename, autodot=1)
gretl_export(M, filename, autodot=1)
\end{code}
The variable \verb|gretl_dotdir| holds the path to the user's ``dot
directory.''  The first function loads a matrix of the given
\texttt{filename} as written by \app{gretl}'s \texttt{mwrite}
function, and the second writes matrix \texttt{M}, under the given
\texttt{filename}, in the format wanted by \app{gretl}.

By default the traffic in matrices goes via the dot directory on the
\app{Python} side; that is, the name of this directory is prepended to
\texttt{filename} for both reading and writing. (This is complementary
to use of the \textsl{export} and \textsl{import} parameters with
\app{gretl}'s \texttt{mwrite} and \texttt{mread} functions,
respectively.) However, if you wish to take control over the reading
and writing locations you can supply a zero value for
\texttt{autodot} when calling \verb|gretl_loadmat| and
\verb|gretl_export|: in that case the \texttt{filename} argument is
used as is.

Note that \verb|gretl_loadmat| and \verb|gretl_export| depend on
\app{NumPy}; they make use of the functions \texttt{loadtxt} and
\texttt{savetxt} respectively. Nonetheless, the presence of
\app{NumPy} is not an absolute requirement if you don't need
to use these two functions.

\section{Illustration: linear regression with multicollinearity}
\label{sec:Python-longley}

Example~\ref{Python-longley} compares the numerical accuracy of
\app{gretl}'s \texttt{ols} command with that of \app{NumPy}'s
\texttt{linalg.lstsq}, using the notorious Longley test data which
exhibit extreme multicollinearity.  Unlike some econometrics packages,
\app{NumPy} does a good job on these data. The script computes and
prints the log-relative error in estimation of the regression
coefficients, using the NIST-certified values as a
benchmark;\footnote{See
  \url{http://www.itl.nist.gov/div898/strd/lls/data/Longley.shtml}.}
the error values correspond to the number of correct digits (with a
maximum of 15). The results will differ somewhat by computer
architecture; the output shown was obtained on a 32-bit Linux Intel i5
system.

   X = gretl_loadmat('X.mat', 1)

   b = np.linalg.lstsq(X, y)[0]
   gretl_export(np.transpose(np.matrix(b)), 'py_b.mat', 1)

matrix py_b = mread("py_b.mat", 1)
matrix errs = logrel_error(b, nist_b) ~ logrel_error(py_b, nist_b)
colnames(errs, "gretl python")
printf "Log-relative errors, Longley coefficients:\n\n%12.5g\n", errs
printf "Column means\n%12.5g\n", meanc(errs)
\end{scode}
Output:
\begin{code}
