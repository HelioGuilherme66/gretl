\chapter{Gretl and Stata}
\label{chap:gretlStata}

\app{Stata} (\url{www.stata.com}) is closed-source, proprietary (and
expensive) software and as such is not a natural companion to
gretl. Nonetheless, given \app{Stata}'s popularity it is
desirable to have a convenient way of comparing results across the two
programs, and to that end we provide some support for \app{Stata}
code under the \texttt{foreign} command.

\tip{To enable support for \app{Stata}, go to the
  Tools/Preferences/General menu item and look under the Programs
  tab. Find the entry for the path to the \app{Stata} executable.
  Adjust the path if it's not already right for your system and you
  should be ready to go.}

The following example illustrates what's available. You can send the
current gretl dataset to \app{Stata} using the \option{send-data}
flag. And having defined a matrix within \app{Stata} you can export it
for use with gretl via the \verb|gretl_export| command: this takes two
arguments, the name of the matrix to export and the filename to use;
the file is written to the user's ``dotdir'', from where it can be
retrieved using the \texttt{mread()} function.\footnote{We do not
  currently offer the complementary functionality of
  \verb|gretl_loadmat|, which enables reading of matrices written by
  gretl's \texttt{mwrite()} function in \app{Ox} and
  \app{Octave}. This is not at all easy to implement in \app{Stata}
  code.} To suppress printed output from \app{Stata} you can add the
\option{quiet} flag to the \texttt{foreign} block.

\begin{script}[htbp]
  \caption{Comparison of clustered standard errors with \app{Stata}}
\begin{scode}
function matrix stata_reorder (matrix se)
  # stata puts the intercept last, but gretl puts it first
  scalar n = rows(se)
  return se[n] | se[1:n-1]
end function

open data4-1
ols 1 0 2 3 --cluster=bedrms
matrix se = $stderr

foreign language=stata --send-data
  regress price sqft bedrms, vce(cluster bedrms)
  matrix vcv = e(V)
  gretl_export vcv "vcv.mat"
end foreign

matrix stata_vcv = mread("vcv.mat", 1)
stata_se = stata_reorder(sqrt(diag(stata_vcv)))
matrix check = se - stata_se
print check
\end{scode}
\label{Stata-test}
\end{script}

In addition you can edit ``pure'' \app{Stata} scripts in the gretl GUI
and send them for execution as with native gretl scripts.

Note that \app{Stata} coerces all variable names to lower-case on data
input, so even if series names in gretl are upper-case, or of mixed
case, it's necessary to use all lower-case in \app{Stata}. Also note
that when opening a data file within \app{Stata} via the \texttt{use}
command it will be necessary to provide the full path to the file.
