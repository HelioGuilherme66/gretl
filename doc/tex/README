This note describes the various LaTeX environments used for "code"
(in a broad sense) in the tex sources for the Gretl User's Guide.

First note that there are two types of code material in the Guide:

(1) Chunks or one-liners interspersed in the text.

(2) Hansl code and/or output packaged as a "float" using
    the "script" environment defined in gretl.sty (on the
    pattern of the figure and table environments).
   
We currently use the environments code, script, scode, scodebit
and outbit (the last being new as of December 2020).

* Use of "code" looks like:

  \begin{code}
     stuff goes here
  \end{code}
  
  The content of this environment is shown in a small monospace
  font and indented relative to the surrounding text. It is
  primarily intended for use (1) above.

* "scode": This is used within the script environment, when the
  only content of the float is program code (no output included).
  
  \begin{script}[...]
  \caption{...}
  \label{...}
  \begin{scode}
     Code goes here
  \end{scode}
  \end{script}
  
  The content is shown in a small monospace font, colored teal, with
  rules at top and bottom.
  
* "scodebit": This should be used within the script environment,
  along with "outbit", when the float contains both program code
  and output:
  
  \begin{script}[...]
  \caption{...}
  \label{...}
  can put short text here
  \begin{scodebit}
     Code goes here
  \end{scodebit}
  can put short text here
  \begin{outbit}
     Output goes here
  \end{outbit}
  \end{script}
  
  The appearance of content within scodebit (and outbit) is the same
  as scode, except that the rules are omitted.

* "outbit": Used in the script environment rather than scodebit to
  signal that its content should not be included when we auto-
  extract scripts from the Guide chapter files.
