\section*{What Hansl is and what it is not}

Hansl is a recursive acronym: it stands for ``Hansl's A Neat Scripting
Language''. You might therefore expect something very general in
purpose. Not really.  Hansl was born as the scripting language for the
econometrics program \app{gretl} and its role is unlikely to change.
As a consequence, hansl should not be viewed as a fully fledged
programming language such as C, FORTRAN, Perl or Python. Not because
it lacks anything to be considered as such,\footnote{Hansl is in fact
  Turing-complete.} but because its aim is different. Hansl should be
considered as a special-purpose or domain-specific language, designed
to make an econometrician's life easier. Hence it incorporates a
series of conventions and choices that may irritate purists and have
some marginal impact on raw performance, but that we, as professional
econometricians, consider ``nice to have''.

On the other hand, hansl is not just a tool to automate rote tasks. It
has several features which make advanced programming possible, such as
structured programming, recursion, complex data structures, and so on.

This makes hansl somewhat different from plain matrix-oriented
interpreted languages, such as the Matlab/Octave family, Ox and so on.
As for style, the language which hansl most resembles is probably the
bash scripting language.

% Other consequences are laid out in chapter \ref{chap:hr-gretl}.

\section*{The intent and structure of this document}

The intended readers of this document are those who already know how
to write code, and are familiar with the associated do-s and don't-s.
Such users may wish to add hansl to their toolbox, alongside languages
like C or FORTRAN, or programs such as R, Ox, Matlab, Stata, Gauss and
the like, some of which they are already confident with. Here,
therefore, the focus is not so much on ``How do I do this?'', but
rather on ``How do I do this \emph{in hansl}?''.

As a consequence, this document aims as making the reader a reasonably
proficient hansl user in a (relatively) short time; however, not all
the features of hansl are illustrated; for those, interested readers
should consult the \GCR{} and \GUG{}.

This guide is divided into three parts. The first part (``Without a
dataset'') concentrates on hansl as a pure matrix-oriented programming
language. The second part (``With a dataset'') exploits the fact that
hansl scripts are run through gretl, which has very nice facilities
for handling statistical datasets (interactively if necessary). This
provides hansl with a series of extra constructs and features which
make it extremely easy to write hansl scripts to perform all sorts
of statistical procedures.

In order to use hansl, you will need a working installation of
gretl. We assume you have one. If you don't, please refer to chapter 1
of the \GUG.

\section*{Where to look for help}

Huge overlap with \app{gretl} $\to$ \GUG, etcetera. The gretl-users
mailing list is also useful.
