\section*{What hansl is and what it is not}

Hansl is a recursive acronym: it stands for ``Hansl's A Neat Scripting
Language''. You might therefore expect something very general in
purpose. Not really.  Hansl was born as the scripting language for the
econometrics program \app{gretl} and its role is unlikely to change.
As a consequence, hansl should not be viewed as a fully fledged
programming language such as C, Fortran, Perl or Python. Not because
it lacks anything to be considered as such,\footnote{Hansl is in fact
  Turing-complete.} but because its aim is different. Hansl should be
considered as a special-purpose or domain-specific language, designed
to make an econometrician's life easier. Hence it incorporates a
series of conventions and choices that may irritate purists and have
some marginal impact on raw performance, but that we, as professional
econometricians, consider ``nice to have''.  This makes hansl somewhat
different from plain matrix-oriented interpreted languages, such as
the Matlab/Octave family, Ox and so on.

On the other hand, hansl is by no means just a tool to automate rote
tasks. It has several features which support advanced work: structured
programming, recursion, complex data structures, and so on.  As for
style, the language which hansl most resembles is probably that of the
bash shell.

\section*{The intent and structure of this document}

The intended readers of this document are those who already know how
to write code, and are familiar with the associated do-s and don't-s.
Such people may wish to add hansl to their toolbox, alongside
languages like C or FORTRAN, or programs such as R, Ox, Matlab, Stata
or Gauss, some of which they are already confident with. Here,
therefore, the focus is not so much on ``How do I do this?'', but
rather on ``How do I do this \emph{in hansl}?''.

As a consequence, this document aims as making the reader a reasonably
proficient hansl user in a (relatively) short time; however, not all
the features of hansl are illustrated; for those, interested readers
should consult the \GCR{} and \GUG{}.

This guide is divided into two parts. Part~\ref{part:hp-nodata}
(``Without a dataset'') concentrates on hansl as a pure
matrix-oriented programming language. Part~\ref{part:hp-data} (``With
a dataset'') exploits the fact that hansl scripts are run through
gretl, which has very nice facilities for handling statistical
datasets (interactively if necessary). This provides hansl with a
series of extra constructs and features which make it extremely easy
to write hansl scripts to perform all sorts of statistical procedures.

In order to use hansl, you will need a working installation of
gretl. We assume you have one. If you don't, please refer to chapter 1
of \GUG.

\section*{Other resources}

If you are serious about learning hansl then after working through
this primer---or in the process of doing so---you'll want to take a
look at the following additional resources.
\begin{itemize}
\item The \GCR. This contains a complete listing of the commands and
  built-in functions available in hansl, with a full account of their
  syntax and options. Examples of usage are provided in some
  instances. This is available in an ``online'' version for handy
  reference as well as in PDF, both accessible via the \textsf{Help} menu
  in the gretl GUI.
\item The \textit{Gretl User's Guide}. Chapters 10 to 16, in
  particular, go into more detail on some of the programming topics
  discussed here (data types, loops, the definition and use of
  functions). In addition Part II of the \textit{Guide}, on
  Econometric Methods, gives many examples of hansl usage. The
  \textit{Guide} is available via gretl's \textsf{Help} menu; the
  latest version can also be found online at
  \url{http://sourceforge.net/projects/gretl/files/manual/}.
\item Sample scripts. The gretl package comes with a large number of
  sample or practice scripts, which can be found under the menu item
  \textsf{/File/Script files/Practice file}. Many of these are simple
  replication exercises for textbook problems but you will find some
  more interesting examples under the \textsf{Gretl} tab.
\item Function packages. Relatively ambitious examples of hansl coding
  can be found in the various contributed ``function packages''. You
  can access these packages via the gretl menu item
  \textsf{/File/Function files/On server}. Right-click on a package
  and select \textsf{View code} to examine the hansl functions.
\item The gretl-users mailing list. Most well-considered
  questions get answered quite quickly and fully. See
  \url{http://lists.wfu.edu/mailman/listinfo/gretl-users}.
