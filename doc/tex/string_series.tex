\label{chap:strval-series}

\section{Introduction}

Gretl's support for data series with string values has gone through
three phases:
\begin{enumerate}
\item No support: we simply rejected non-numerical values when reading
  data from file.
\item Numeric encoding only: we would read a string-valued series from
  a delimited text data file (provided the series didn't mix numerical
  values and strings) but the representation of the data within gretl
  was purely numerical. We printed a ``string table'' showing the
  mapping between the original strings and gretl's encoding and it was
  up to the user to keep track of this mapping.
\item Preservation of string values: the string table that we
  construct in reading a string-valued series is now stored as a
  component of the dataset so it's possible to display and manipulate
  these values within gretl.
\end{enumerate}

The third phase has now been in effect for several years, with a
series of gradual refinements. This chapter gives an account of the
status quo. It explains how to create string-valued series and
describes the operations that are supported for such series.

\section{Creating a string-valued series}

This can be done in two ways: first, by reading such a series from a
suitable source file and second, by taking a suitable numerical series
within gretl and adding string values using the \cmd{stringify()}
function. In either case string values will be preserved when such
a series is saved in a gretl-native data file.

\subsection{Reading string-valued series}
\label{sec:reading}

The primary ``suitable source'' for string-valued series is a
delimited text data file (but see section\ref{sec:other-imports}
below). Here's a little example. The following is the content of a
file named \texttt{gc.csv}:
%
\begin{code}
city,year
"Bilbao",2009
"Toruń",2011
"Oklahoma City",2013
"Berlin",2015
"Athens",2017
"Naples",2019
\end{code}
%
and here's a script:
%
\begin{code}
open gc.csv --quiet
print --byobs
print city --byobs --numeric
printf "The third gretl conference took place in %s.\n", city[3]
\end{code}

The output from the script is:
%
\begin{code}
? print --byobs

          city         year

1       Bilbao         2009
2        Toruń         2011
3 Oklahoma C..         2013
4       Berlin         2015
5       Athens         2017
6       Naples         2019

? print city --byobs --numeric

          city

1            1
2            2
3            3
4            4
5            5
6            6

The third gretl conference took place in Oklahoma City.
\end{code}

From this we can see a few things. 
\begin{itemize}
\item By default the \cmd{print} command shows us the string values
  of the series \texttt{city}, and it handles non-ASCII characters
  provided they're in UTF-8 (but it doesn't handle longer strings
  very elegantly).
\item The \verb|--numeric| option to \cmd{print} exposes the
  numeric codes for a string-valued series.
\item The syntax \texttt{seriesname[obs]} gives a string when a series
  is string-valued.
\end{itemize}

Suppose you want to access the numeric code for a particular
string-valued observation: you can get that by ``casting'' the series
to a vector. Thus
\begin{code}
printf "The code for '%s' is %d.\n", city[3], {city}[3]
\end{code}
gives
\begin{code}
The code for 'Oklahoma City' is 3.
\end{code}

The numeric codes for string-valued series are always assigned thus:
reading the data file row by row, the first string value is assigned
1, the next \textit{distinct} string value is assigned 2, and so on.

\subsection{Assigning string values to an existing series}
\label{sec:stringify}

This is done via the \cmd{stringify()} function, which takes two
arguments, the name of a series and an array of strings. For this to
work two conditions must be met:

\begin{enumerate}
\item The series must have only integer values and the smallest value
  must be 1 or greater.
\item The array of strings must have at least $n$ distinct members,
  where $n$ is the largest value found in the series.
\end{enumerate}

The logic of these conditions is that we're looking to create a
mapping as described above, from a 1-based sequence of integers to a
set of strings. However, we're allowing for the possibility that the
series in question is an incomplete sample from an associated
population. Suppose we have a series that goes 2, 3, 5, 9, 10. This is
taken to be a sample from a population that has at least 10 discrete
values, 1, 2, \dots{}, 10, and so requires at least 10 value-strings.

Here's (a simplified version of) an example that one of the authors
has had cause to use: deriving US-style ``letter grades'' from a
series containing percentage scores for students. Call the percentage
series $x$, and say we want to create a series with values \texttt{A}
for $x \geq 90$, \texttt{B} for $80 \leq x <90$, and so on down to
\texttt{F} for $x<60$. Then we can do:
\begin{code}
series grade = 1 # F, the least value
grade += x >= 60 # D
grade += x >= 70 # C
grade += x >= 80 # B
grade += x >= 90 # A
stringify(grade, strsplit("F D C B A"))
\end{code}
%
The way the \texttt{grade} series is constructed is not the most
compact, but it's nice and explicit, and easy to amend if one wants to
adjust the threshold values. Note the use of \cmd{strsplit()} to
create an on-the-fly array of strings from a string literal; this is
convenient when the array contains a moderate number of elements with
no embedded spaces. An alternative way to get the same result is to
define the array of strings via the \cmd{defarray()} function, as in
\begin{code}
stringify(grade,defarray("F","D","C","B","A"))
\end{code}

The inverse operation of \cmd{stringify()} can be performed by the
\cmd{strvals()} function: this retrieves the array of string values
from a series (or returns an empty array if the series is not
string-valued).

\section{Permitted operations}

One question that arises with string-valued series is, what are you
allowed to do with them and what is banned? This is a debatable point,
but here we set out the current state of things.

\subsection{Setting values per observation}

You can set particular values in a string-valued series either by
string or numeric code. For example, suppose (in relation to the
example in section~\ref{sec:stringify}) that for some reason student
number 31 with a percentage score of 88 nonetheless merits an
\texttt{A} grade. We could do
\begin{code}
grade[31] = "A"
\end{code}
or, if we're confident about the mapping,
\begin{code}
grade[31] = 5
\end{code}
Or to raise the student's grade by one letter:
\begin{code}
grade[31] += 1
\end{code}

What you're \textit{not} allowed to do here is make a numerical
adjustment that would put the value out of bounds in relation to the
set of string values. For example, if we tried \texttt{grade[31] = 6}
we'd get an error. 

On the other hand, you \textit{can} implicitly extend the set of
string values. This wouldn't make sense for the letter grades example
but it might for, say, city names. Returning to the example in
section~\ref{sec:reading} suppose we try
%
\begin{code}
dataset addobs 1
year[7] = 2021
city[7] = "London?"
\end{code}
%
This will work: we're implicitly adding another member to the string
table for \texttt{city}; the associated numeric code will be the next
available integer.\footnote{Admittedly there is a downside to this
  feature: one may inadvertently add a new string value by mistyping a
  string that's already present.}

\subsection{Assignment to an entire series}

This is disallowed at present: you can't execute an assignment of any
sort with the name of a string-valued series \textit{per se} on the
left-hand side. Put differently, you cannot overwrite an entire
string-valued series at once. While this is debatable, it's the
easiest way of ensuring that we never end up with a broken
mapping. It's possible this restriction may be relaxed in future.

Besides assigning an out-of-bounds numerical value to a particular
observation, this sort of assignment is in fact the only operation
that is banned for string-valued series.

\subsection{Missing values}

We support one exception to the general rule, never break the mapping
between strings and numeric codes for string-valued series: you can
mark particular observations as missing. This is done in the usual
way, e.g.,
\begin{code}
grade[31] = NA
\end{code}
Note, however, that on importing a string series from a delimited text
file any non-blank strings (including ``NA'') will be interpreted as
valid values; any missing values in such a file should therefore be
represented by blank cells.

\subsection{Copying a string-valued series}

If you make a copy of a string-valued series, as in
\begin{code}
series foo = city
\end{code}
the string values are \textit{not} copied over: you get a purely
numerical series holding the codes of the original series. But if you
want a full copy with the string values that can easily be arranged:
\begin{code}
series citycopy = city
stringify(citycopy, strvals(city))
\end{code}

\subsection{String-valued series in other contexts}

String-valued series can be used on the right-hand side of assignment
statements at will, and in that context their numerical values are
taken. For example,
%
\begin{code}
series y = sqrt(city)
\end{code}
%
will elicit no complaint and generate a numerical series 1, 1.41421,
\dots{}. It's up to the user to judge whether this sort of thing
makes any sense.

Similarly, it's up to the user to decide if it makes sense to use a
string-valued series ``as is'' in a regression model, whether as
regressand or regressor---again, the numerical values of the series
are taken. Often this will not make sense, but sometimes it may: the
numerical values may by design form an ordinal, or even a cardinal,
scale (as in the ``grade'' example in section~\ref{sec:stringify}).

More likely, one would want to use \cmd{dummify} on a string-valued
series before using it in statistical modeling. In that context
gretl's series labels are suitably informative. For example, suppose
we have a series \texttt{race} with numerical values 1, 2 and 3 and
associated strings ``White'', ``Black'' and ``Other''. Then the hansl
code
\begin{code}
list D = dummify(race)
labels
\end{code}
will show these labels:
\begin{code}
Drace_2: dummy for race = 'Black'
Drace_3: dummy for race = 'Other'
\end{code}

Given such a series you can use string values in a sample restriction,
as in
\begin{code}
smpl race == "Black" --restrict
\end{code}
(although \texttt{race == 2} would also be acceptable).

There may be other contexts that we haven't yet thought of where it
would be good to have string values displayed and/or accepted on
input; suggestions are welcome.

\section{String-valued series and functions}

User-defined hansl functions can deal with string-valued series,
although there are a few points to note.

If you supply such a series as an argument to a hansl function its
string values will be accessible within the function. One can test
whether a given series \texttt{arg} is string-valued as follows:
\begin{code}
if nelem(strvals(arg)) > 0
  # yes
else
  # no
endif
\end{code}

Now suppose one wanted to put something like the code that generated
the \texttt{grade} series in section~\ref{sec:stringify} into a
function. That can be done, but \textit{not} in the form of a function
that directly returns the desired series---that is, something like
\begin{code}
function series letter_grade (series x)
  series grade
  # define grade based on x and stringify it, as shown above
  return grade
end function
\end{code}
%
Unfortunately the above will \emph{not} work: the caller will get the
\texttt{grade} series OK but it won't be string-valued. At first sight
this may seem to be a bug but it's defensible as a consequence of the
way series work in gretl.

The point is that series have, so to speak, two grades of
existence. They can exist as fully-fledged members of a dataset, or
they can have a fleeting existence as simply anonymous arrays of
numbers that are of the same length as dataset series. Consider the
statement
\begin{code}
series rootx1 = sqrt(x+1)
\end{code}
On the right-hand side we have the ``series'' \texttt{x+1}, which is
called into existence as part of a calculation but has no name and
cannot have string values. Similarly, consider
\begin{code}
series grade = letter_grade(x)
\end{code}
The return value from \verb|letter_grade()| is likewise an anonymous
array,\footnote{A proper named series, with string values, existed
  while the function was executing but it ceased to exist as soon as
  the function was finished.} incapable of holding string values
\textit{until} it gets assigned to the named series
\texttt{grade}. The solution is to define \texttt{grade} as a series,
at the level of the caller, before calling \verb|letter_grade()|, as
in
%
\begin{code}
function void letter_grade (series x, series *grade)
  # define grade based on x and stringify it
  # this version will work!
end function

# caller
...
series grade
letter_grade(x, &grade)
\end{code}

As you'll see from the account above, we don't offer any very fancy
facilities for string-valued series. We'll read them from suitable
sources and we'll create them natively via \cmd{stringify}---and
we'll try to ensure that they retain their integrity---but we don't,
for example, take the specification of a string-valued series as a
regressor as an implicit request to include the dummification of its
distinct values. Besides laziness, this reflects the fact that in
gretl a string-valued series \textit{may} be usable ``as is'',
depending on how it's defined; you can use \cmd{dummify} if you
need it.

\section{Other import formats}
\label{sec:other-imports}

In section~\ref{sec:reading} we illustrated the reading of
string-valued series with reference to a delimited text data
file. Gretl can also handle several other sources of string-valued
data, including the spreadsheet formats \texttt{xls}, \texttt{xlsx},
\texttt{gnumeric} and \texttt{ods} and (to a degree) the formats of
\textsf{Stata}, \textsf{SAS} and \textsf{SPSS}.

\subsection{Stata files}

Stata supports two relevant sorts of variables: (1) those that are of
``string type'' and (2) variables of one or other numeric type that
have ``value labels'' defined. Neither of these is exactly equivalent
to what we call a ``string-valued series'' in gretl.

Stata variables of string type have no numeric representation; their
values are literally strings, and that's all. Stata's numeric
variables with value labels do not have to be integer-valued and their
least value does not have to be 1; however, you can't define a label
for a value that is not an integer. Thus in Stata you can have a
series that comprises both integer and non-integer values, but only
the integer values can be labeled.\footnote{Verified in Stata 12.}

This means that on import to gretl we can readily handle variables of
string type from Stata's \texttt{dta} files. We give them a 1-based
numeric encoding; this is arbitrary but does not conflict with any
information in the \texttt{dta} file. On the other hand, in general
we're not able to handle Stata's numeric variables with value labels;
currently we report the value labels to the user but do not attempt to
store them in the gretl dataset. We could check such variables and
import them as string-valued series if they satisfy the criteria
stated in section~\ref{sec:stringify} but we don't at present.

\subsection{SAS and SPSS files}

Gretl is able to read and preserve string values associated with
variables from SAS ``export'' (\texttt{xpt}) files, and also from SPSS
\texttt{sav} files. Such variables seem to be on the same pattern as
Stata variables of string type.
