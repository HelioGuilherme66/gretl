What's here?

skeleton.c makes a program called "skeleton", which goes through
the full list of gretl commands (from libgretl) and outputs a
skeleton XML command reference.  Mostly this is blank, but it
does contain a correct listing of the options available in
connection with each command (if any), again taken from libgretl.

The output of skeleton is directed to skeleton.xml, an xml file
that should validate in relation to the gretl command reference
DTD, gretl_commands.dtd.  This could provide a basis for a
translation.  

formatter.c makes a program called "formatter", which parses an
XML command listing such as skeleton.xml.  The idea is that this
program will be developed to the point where it can output:

* a replacement for cmdref.xml, the command reference chapter of
  the manual

* the "online" help files gretl.hlp and gretlcli.hlp

Right now it outputs a sort of "proof of concept" simple
(incomplete) text printout, and also sends very incomplete XML
output to trial.xml, in something like the format this is wanted
for cmdref.xml.

You will probably have to edit the Makefile before doing anything
else.  Once that's ready, try:

make testprint.txt

and take a look at the output: skeleton.xml, testprint.txt and
trial.xml
