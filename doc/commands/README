What's here?

skeleton.c makes a program called "skeleton", which goes through
the full list of gretl commands (from libgretl) and outputs a
skeleton XML command reference.  Mostly this is blank, but it
does contain a correct listing of the options available in
connection with each command (if any), again taken from libgretl.

The output of skeleton is directed to skeleton.xml, an xml file
that should validate in relation to the gretl command reference
DTD, gretl_commands.dtd.

formatter.c makes a program called "formatter.c", which parses an
XML command listing such as skeleton.xml.  The idea is that this
program will be developed to the point where it can output:

* a replacement for cmdref.xml, the command reference chapter of
  the manual

* the "online" help files gretl.hlp and gretlcli.hlp

Right now it does neither of these things: it just sends to stdout
a sort of "proof of concept" simple (incomplete) text printout.

To see the whole thing in action, do "make testprint.txt".  You
will probably have to edit the Makefile first though.
