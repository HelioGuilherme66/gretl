What's here?

----------

skeleton.c makes a program called "skeleton", which goes through
the full list of gretl commands (from libgretl) and outputs a
skeleton XML command reference.  Mostly this is blank, but it
contain a mostly correct listing of the options available in
connection with each command (if any), again taken from libgretl.

The output of skeleton is directed to skeleton.xml, an xml file
that should validate in relation to the gretl command reference
DTD, gretl_commands.dtd.  This could provide a basis for a
translation.  It is designed as a purely content-oriented
"database" for the gretl command reference.

The DTD itself is, I'd say, more than half-done.  It could do with
some more work in places, and as we go through the entire command
listing I'm sure we'll find that more elements or attributes
need to be added (e.g., for tables, which appear in the manual
entries for some commands).

------------

formatter.c makes a program called "formatter", which parses an
XML command listing such as skeleton.xml and uses XSL to transform
the information.  The program is very short and uses libxml and 
libxsl to do most of the work. The idea is that this approach
will be developed to the point where it can output:

* a replacement for cmdref.xml, the command reference chapter of
  the manual

* the "online" help files gretl.hlp and gretlcli.hlp

This is partly implemented at present.  It uses the two XSL
stylesheets, gretlman.xsl and gretltxt.xsl.  These need more work.
Right now the text stylesheet leaves a certain amount of work undone,
and it is supplemented by a C post-processor (see doline.c, which is
used to make the "reflow" program.)  

You will probably have to edit the Makefile before doing anything
else.  Once that's ready, try:

make test

and take a look at the output: skeleton.xml.

You may also try

make chapter

which processes inprogress.xml.  This file is based on skeleton.xml,
but I have now filled out most of the fields with the content from the
existing manual and helpfiles. "make chapter" should generate
command.xml and commands.hlp.  The first of these is  part-way towards
the chapters/cmdref.xml replacement, while the second is part-way to a
replacement for the online help file(s).
