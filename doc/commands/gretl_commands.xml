	Analysis of Variance: <repl>response</repl> is a series measuring some
	effect of interest and <repl>treatment</repl> must be a discrete
	variable that codes for two or more types of treatment (or
	non-treatment).  For two-way ANOVA, the <repl>block</repl> variable

	variable.

	Opens a data file and appends the content to the current

	to detect the format of the data file (native, plain text,
	CSV, Gnumeric, Excel, etc.).
      </para>
      <para>
	The appended data may take the form of either additional
	observations on series already present in the dataset, and/or
	new series. In the case of adding series, compatibility
	requires either (a) that the number of observations for the
	new data equals that for the current data, or (b) that the new
	data carries clear observation information so that gretl can
	work out how to place the values.
      </para>
      <para>
	One case that is not supported is where the new data start
	earlier and also end later than the original data. To add new
	series in such a case you can use the <opt>fixed-sample</opt>
	option; this has the effect of suppressing the adding of
	observations, and so restricting the operation to the addition
	of new series.
      </para>
      <para>
	A special feature is supported for appending to a panel
	dataset. Let <math>n</math> denote the number of
	cross-sectional units in the panel, <math>T</math> denote the
	number of time periods, and <math>m</math> denote the number
	of observations for the new data. If <math>m = n</math> the
	new data are taken to be time-invariant, and are copied into
	place for each time period. On the other hand, if <math>m =
	T</math> the data are treated as non-varying across the panel
	units, and are copied into place for each unit. If the panel
	is <quote>square</quote>, and <math>m</math> equals both
	<math>n</math> and <math>T</math>, an ambiguity arises. The
	default in this case is to treat the new data as
	time-invariant, but you can force gretl to treat the new data
	as time series via the <opt>time-series</opt> option.  (This
	option is ignored in all other cases.)
      </para>
      <para>
	When a data file is selected for appending, there may be an
	area of overlap with the existing dataset; that is, one or
	more series may have one or more observations in common across
	the two sources. If the option <opt>update-overlap</opt> is
	given, the <lit>append</lit> operation will replace any
	overlapping observations with the values from the selected
	data file, otherwise the values currently in place will be
	unaffected.
      </para>
      <para>
	The additional specialized options <opt>sheet</opt>,
	<opt>coloffset</opt>, <opt>rowoffset</opt> and

	targ="open"/>; see that command for explanations.

	The default method is the Cochrane&ndash;Orcutt iterative
	procedure; see for example section 9.4 of <cite
	key="ramanathan02">Ramanathan (2002)</cite>. The criterion for
	convergence is that successive estimates of the
	autocorrelation coefficient do not differ by more than 1e-6,
	or if the <opt>loose</opt> option is given, by more than
	0.001. If this is not achieved within 100 iterations an error
	is flagged.
      </para>
      <para>
	If the <opt>pwe</opt> option is given, the
	Prais&ndash;Winsten estimator is used.  This involves an an
	iteration similar to Cochrane&ndash;Orcutt; the difference is
	that while Cochrane&ndash;Orcutt discards the first
	observation, Prais&ndash;Winsten makes use of it. See, for
	example, Chapter 13 of <cite key="greene00">Greene
	(2000)</cite> for details.

      <para>
	If the <opt>hilu</opt> option is given, the
	Hildreth&ndash;Lu search procedure is used.  The results are
	then fine-tuned using the Cochrane&ndash;Orcutt method, unless
	the <opt>no-corc</opt> flag is specified. The
	<opt>no-corc</opt> option is ignored for estimators other
	than Hildreth&ndash;Lu.

      <para>
	Carries out estimation of dynamic panel data models (that is,
	panel models including one or more lags of the dependent
	variable) using the GMM-DIF method set out by <cite
	key="arellano-bond91">Arellano and Bond (1991)</cite>.
	Please see <cmdref targ="dpanel"/> for an updated and
	more flexible version of this command which handles GMM-SYS
	as well as GMM-DIF.
      </para>
      <para>
	The parameter <repl>p</repl> represents the order of the
	autoregression for the dependent variable.  The optional parameter
	<repl>q</repl> indicates the maximum lag of the level of the
	dependent variable to be used as an instrument.  If this argument
	is omitted, or given as 0, all available lags are used.
      </para>
      <para>
	The dependent variable should be given in levels form; it will be
	automatically differenced (since this estimator uses differencing
	to cancel out the individual effects).  The independent variables
	are not automatically differenced; if you want to use differences
	(which will generally be the case for ordinary quantitative
	variables, though perhaps not for, say, time dummy variables) you
	should create the differences first then specify these as the
	regressors. 
      </para>
      <para>
	The last (optional) field in the command is for specifying
	instruments.  If no instruments are given, it is assumed that
	all the independent variables are strictly exogenous.  If you
	specify any instruments, you should include in the list any
	strictly exogenous independent variables.  For predetermined
	regressors, you can use the <lit>GMM</lit> function to include
	a specified range of lags in block-diagonal fashion.  This is
	illustrated in the third example above.  The first argument to
	<lit>GMM</lit> is the name of the variable in question, the
	second is the minimum lag to be used as an instrument, and the
	third is the maximum lag.  If the third argument is given as
	0, all available lags are used.
      </para>
      <para>
	By default the results of 1-step estimation are reported (with
	robust standard errors).  You may select 2-step estimation as
	an option.  In both cases tests for autocorrelation of orders
	1 and 2 are provided, as well as the Sargan overidentification
	test and a Wald test for the joint significance of the
	regressors.  Note that in this differenced model first-order
	autocorrelation is not a threat to the validity of the model,
	but second-order autocorrelation violates the maintained
	statistical assumptions.
      </para>
      <para>
	In the case of 2-step estimation, standard errors are by
	default computed using the finite-sample correction suggested
	by <cite key="windmeijer05">Windmeijer (2005)</cite>.  The
	standard asymptotic standard errors associated with the 2-step
	estimator are generally reckoned to be an unreliable guide to
	inference, but if for some reason you want to see them you can
	use the <opt>asymptotic</opt> option to turn off the
	Windmeijer correction.
      </para>
      <para>
	If the <opt>time-dummies</opt> option is given, a set of
	time dummy variables is added to the specified regressors.  
	The number of dummies is one less than the maximum number of
	periods used in estimation, to avoid perfect collinearity with
	the constant.  The dummies are entered in levels; if you wish
	to use time dummies in first-differenced form, you will have
	to define and add these variables manually.

	differencing order, and the moving average (MA) order
	respectively.  These values may be given in numerical form, or
	as the names of pre-existing scalar variables.  A
	<repl>d</repl> value of 1, for instance, means that the first
	difference of the dependent variable should be taken before
	estimating the ARMA parameters.
      </para>

      <para context="cli">
	If you wish to include only specific AR or MA lags in the

	the name of a pre-defined matrix containing a set of integer

	data).  These orders may be given in numerical form or as
	scalar variables.

      <para context="cli">
	In the univariate case the default is to include an intercept

	    The sort of analysis to perform.  The default (95 percent)
	    confidence interval is based directly on the quantiles of
	    the bootstrap coefficient estimates.  The
	    <quote>studentized</quote> version is as per Davidson and
	    MacKinnon's <cite key="davidson-mackinnon04">Economic
	    Theory and Methods</cite> (ETM), chapter 5: at each
	    bootstrap replication a <math>t</math>-ratio is formed as
	    the difference between the bootstrap and the baseline
	    coefficient estimates, divided by the bootstrap standard
	    error. The confidence interval is then based on the
	    quantiles of this bootstrap <math>t</math>-ratio, as
	    explained in ETM.  The P-value option is based on the
	    distribution of the bootstrap <math>t</math>-ratio: it is
	    the proportion of the replications where the absolute
	    value of this statistic exceeds the absolute value of the
	    baseline <math>t</math>-ratio.

	    The bootstrap method. Under the first option the residuals

	    <quote>pairs</quote> or <quote>cases</quote>; that is, the
	    <math>y</math>, <math>X</math> data rows. In the third
	    option the original residuals are first transformed as per
	    <cite key="davidson-flachaire01">Davidson and Flachaire
	    (2001)</cite>, then on each bootstrap replication each
	    transformed residual is multiplied by either 1 or
	    &minus;1, with probability 0.5 in either case.  In the

	    The number of replications to perform. Note that when

	    (where <math>B</math> is the number of replications).  So

	it is bounded by the first and third quartiles.  The
	<quote>whiskers</quote> extend from each end of the box for a
	range equal to 1.5 times the interquartile range. Observations
	outside that range are considered outliers and represented via
	dots.  A line is drawn across the box at the median.  A
	<quote>+</quote> sign is used to indicate the mean.  If the

    label="Compact data">

    <description>

      <para>
	When you add to a dataset a series that is of higher
	frequency, it is necessary to <quote>compact</quote> the new
	series.  For instance, a monthly series will have to be
	compacted to fit into a quarterly dataset.
      </para>  

      <para>
	In addition, you may sometimes want to compact an entire
	dataset to a lower frequency (perhaps, prior to adding a
	lower-frequency variable to the dataset).
      </para>

      <para>Gretl offers five options for compacting:</para>

      <ilist>
	<li><para>Averaging: The value written to the dataset will be
	    the arithmetic mean of the relevant series values.  For
	    instance the value written for the first quarter of 1990
	    will be the average of the values for January, February
	    and March of 1990.</para>
	</li>
	<li><para>Summing: The value written to the dataset will be
	    the sum of the relevant higher-frequency values.  For
	    example, the first-quarter value will be the sum of the
	    January, February and March values.</para>
	</li>
	<li><para>End-of-period values: The value written to the
	    dataset is the last relevant value from the
	    higher-frequency data.  For example, the first quarter of
	    1990 will get the March 1990 value.</para>
	</li>
	<li><para>Start-of-period values: The value written to the
	    dataset is the first relevant value from the
	    higher-frequency data.  For example, the first quarter of
	    1990 will get the January 1990 value.</para>
	</li>
	<li>
	  <para>
	  <quote>Spreading</quote>: In this case no higher-frequency
	  information is lost; rather, it is spread over a set of
	  <math>m</math> series, where <math>m</math> is the ratio of
	  the higher frequency to the lower. Each series in the set
	  holds the values from a given sub-period, which is
	  identified by a specific suffix. For example, when
	  compacting a series <lit>x</lit> from monthly to quarterly
	  the names of the generated series will be <lit>x_m01</lit>,
	  <lit>x_m02</lit> and <lit>x_m03</lit>, for the three
	  months in each quarter.
	  </para>
	</li>	
      </ilist>

      <para>
	In the case of compacting an entire dataset, the choice you
	make in this dialog box sets the default method.  But if you
	have set a compaction method for an individual variable (menu
	item <quote>Variable/Edit attributes</quote>) that method is
	used rather than the default.  If the compaction method is
	already set for all variables, the choice of a default
	compaction method is not presented.

	<cmdref targ="setobs"/> and <cmdref targ="smpl"/> commands prior
	to using this command. Here is a full example:</para>
      <code>

	smpl ; 1999:4
	data GDP_JP GDP_UK
      </code>
      <para>
	The commands above open a database named
	<filename>macrodat.rat</filename>, establish a quarterly data set
	starting in the first quarter of 1959 and ending in the fourth
	quarter of 1999, and then import the series named
	<lit>GDP_JP</lit> and <lit>GDP_UK</lit>.</para>
      <para>
	If <lit>setobs</lit> and <lit>smpl</lit> are not specified in this

      <code>

      <para>
	The five available compaction methods are
	<quote>average</quote> (takes the mean of the high frequency
	observations), <quote>last</quote> (uses the last
	observation), <quote>first</quote>, <quote>sum</quote> and
	<quote>spread</quote>.  If no method is specified, the default
	is to use the average. The <quote>spread</quote> method is
	special: no information is lost, rather it is spread across
	multiple series, one per sub-period. So for example when
	adding a monthly series to a quarterly dataset three
	series are created, one for each month of the quarter;
	their names bear the suffixes <lit>m01</lit>, <lit>m02</lit>
	and <lit>m03</lit>.
      </para>
      <para>
	If the series to be read are of lower frequency than the
	working dataset, the default is to repeat the values of the
	added data as required, but the <opt>interpolate</opt> option
	can be used to request interpolation using the method of <cite
	key="chowlin71">Chow and Lin (1971)</cite>: the regressors are
	a constant and quadratic trend and an AR(1) disturbance
	process is assumed. Note, however, that this option is
	available only for conversion from quarterly data to monthly
	or annual data to quarterly.
      </para>
      <para>
	In the case of native gretl databases (only), the

	This dialog enables you to specify additional files to be
	included with a function package. Including such material
	implies that the package takes the form of a zip file.  If
	gretl is to build the zip file for you, all files referenced
	here must be present in the same directory as the gfn file.
	Sub-directories can be listed as well as regular files; in
	that case it is implied that all of their contents should be
	included in the zip package.
      </para>
      <para>
	There are two main intended uses for this facility. First, you
	can include a data file for use with the package's sample
	script, if none of the data files supplied with the gretl
	distribution are suitable. In this case the data should be in
	gretl native format (<lit>gdt</lit> or binary
	<lit>gdtb</lit>). Second, if your package requires a big
	matrix (for example, holding critical values for a specialized
	test statistic) it may be more convenient to include this as a
	gretl matrix file (<lit>mat</lit>) than to assemble the matrix
	via multiple hansl statements.
      </para>
      <para>
	To access a packaged <lit>gdt</lit> or <lit>gdtb</lit> file

	exception of <lit>clear</lit>, these actions are not available
	when the dataset is currently subsampled by selection of cases
	on some Boolean criterion.
      </para>
      <para>
	<lit>addobs</lit>: Must be followed by a positive integer.  Adds
	the specified number of extra observations to the end of the
	working dataset.  This is primarily intended for forecasting
	purposes.  The values of most variables over the additional range
	will be set to missing, but certain deterministic variables are
	recognized and extended, namely, a simple linear trend and
	periodic dummy variables. 
      </para>
      <para>
	<lit>insobs</lit>: Must be followed by a positive integer no
	greater than the current number of observations. Inserts a
	single observation at the specified position. All subsequent
	data are shifted by one place and the dataset is extended by
	one observation. All variables apart from the constant are
	given missing values at the new observation. This action is
	not available for panel datasets.
      </para>
      <para>
	<lit>clear</lit>: No parameter required.  Clears out the current
	data, returning gretl to its initial <quote>empty</quote> state.
      </para>      
      <para>
	<lit>compact</lit>: Must be followed by a positive integer
	representing a new data frequency, which should be lower than
	the current frequency (for example, a value of 4 when the
	current frequency is 12 indicates compaction from monthly to
	quarterly).  This command is available for time series data
	only; it compacts all the series in the data set to the new
	frequency.  A second parameter may be given, namely one of
	<lit>sum</lit>, <lit>first</lit>, <lit>last</lit> or
	<lit>spread</lit>, to specify, respectively, compaction using
	the sum of the higher-frequency values, start-of-period
	values, end-of-period values, or spreading of the
	higher-frequency values across multiple series (one per
	sub-period).  The default is to compact by averaging.
      </para>
      <para>
	<lit>expand</lit>: This command is only available for annual
	or quarterly time series data: annual data can be expanded to
	quarterly, and quarterly data to monthly frequency. By default
	all the series in the data set are padded out to the new
	frequency by repeating the existing values, but if the
	modifier <lit>interp</lit> is appended then the series are
	expanded using Chow&ndash;Lin interpolation (see <cite
	key="chowlin71">Chow and Lin, 1971</cite>): the regressors are
	a constant and quadratic trend and an AR(1) disturbance
	process is assumed.
      </para>
      <para>
	<lit>transpose</lit>: No additional parameter required.
	Transposes the current data set.  That is, each observation (row)
	in the current data set will be treated as a variable (column),
	and each variable as an observation.  This command may be useful
	if data have been read from some external source in which the rows
	of the data table represent variables.
      </para>
      <para>
	<lit>sortby</lit>: The name of a single series or list is
	required. If one series is given, the observations on all
	variables in the dataset are re-ordered by increasing value of
	the specified series. If a list is given, the sort proceeds
	hierarchically: if the observations are tied in sort order
	with respect to the first key variable then the second key is
	used to break the tie, and so on until the tie is broken or
	the keys are exhausted. Note that this command is available
	only for undated data.
      </para>
      <para>
	<lit>dsortby</lit>: Works as <lit>sortby</lit> except that
	the re-ordering is by decreasing value of the key series.
      </para>
      <para>
	<lit>resample</lit>: Constructs a new dataset by random
	sampling, with replacement, of the rows of the current dataset.
	One argument is required, namely the number of rows to
	include.  This may be less than, equal to, or greater than
	the number of observations in the original data.  The
	original dataset can be retrieved via the command
	<lit>smpl full</lit>.  
      </para>
      <para>
	<lit>renumber</lit>: Requires the name of an existing series
	followed by an integer between 1 and the number of series in the
	dataset minus one. Moves the specified series to the specified
	position in the dataset, renumbering the other series
	accordingly. (Position 0 is occupied by the constant, which
	cannot be moved.)
      </para>
      <para>
	<lit>pad-daily</lit>: Valid only if the current dataset
	contains dated daily data with an incomplete calendar. The
	effect is to pad the data out to a complete calendar by
	inserting blank rows (that is, rows containing nothing but
	<lit>NA</lit>s). This option requires an integer parameter,
	namely the number of days per week, which must be 5, 6 or 7,
	and must be greater than or equal to the current data
	frequency. On successful completion, the data calendar will be
	<quote>complete</quote> relative to this value. For example if
	days-per-week is 5 then all weekdays will be represented,
	whether or not any data are available for those days.

      </para>
      <para>
	With the <opt>sign</opt> option, the Sign test is performed.
	This test is based on the fact that if two samples,
	<math>x</math> and <math>y</math>, are drawn randomly
	from the same distribution, the probability that
	<math>x</math><sub>i</sub> &gt;
	<math>y</math><sub>i</sub>, for each observation
	<math>i</math>, should equal 0.5.  The test statistic is
	<math>w</math>, the number of observations for which
	<math>x</math><sub>i</sub> &gt;
	<math>y</math><sub>i</sub>. Under the null hypothesis this
	follows the Binomial distribution with parameters
	(<math>n</math>, 0.5), where <math>n</math> is the
	number of observations.
      </para>
      <para>
	With the <opt>rank-sum</opt> option, the Wilcoxon rank-sum test
	is performed.  This test proceeds by ranking the observations from
	both samples jointly, from smallest to largest, then finding the
	sum of the ranks of the observations from one of the samples.  The
	two samples do not have to be of the same size, and if they differ
	the smaller sample is used in calculating the rank-sum.  Under the
	null hypothesis that the samples are drawn from populations with
	the same median, the probability distribution of the rank-sum can
	be computed for any given sample sizes; and for reasonably large
	samples a close Normal approximation exists.
      </para>
      <para>
	With the <opt>signed-rank</opt> option, the Wilcoxon signed-rank
	test is performed.  This is designed for matched data pairs such
	as, for example, the values of a variable for a sample of
	individuals before and after some treatment.  The test proceeds by
	finding the differences between the paired observations,
	<math>x</math><sub>i</sub> &minus;
	<math>y</math><sub>i</sub>, ranking these differences by
	absolute value, then assigning to each pair a signed rank, the
	sign agreeing with the sign of the difference.  One then
	calculates <math>W</math><sub>+</sub>, the sum of the
	positive signed ranks.  As with the rank-sum test, this statistic
	has a well-defined distribution under the null that the median
	difference is zero, which converges to the Normal for samples
	of reasonable size.
      </para>
      <para>
	For the Wilcoxon tests, if the <opt>verbose</opt> option is
	given then the ranking is printed.  (This option has no effect if

      <para>
	Carries out estimation of dynamic panel data models (that is,
	panel models including one or more lags of the dependent
	variable) using either the GMM-DIF or GMM-SYS method.
      </para>
      <para context="cli">
	The parameter <repl>p</repl> represents the order of the
	autoregression for the dependent variable. In the simplest
	case this is a scalar value, but a pre-defined matrix may be
	given for this argument, to specify a set of (possibly
	non-contiguous) lags to be used.
      </para>
      <para>
	The dependent variable and regressors should be given in
	levels form; they will be differenced automatically (since
	this estimator uses differencing to cancel out the individual
	effects).
      </para>
      <para context="cli">
	The last (optional) field in the command is for specifying
	instruments.  If no instruments are given, it is assumed that all
	the independent variables are strictly exogenous.  If you specify
	any instruments, you should include in the list any strictly
	exogenous independent variables.  For predetermined regressors,
	you can use the <lit>GMM</lit> function to include a specified
	range of lags in block-diagonal fashion.  This is illustrated in
	the third example above.  The first argument to <lit>GMM</lit> is
	the name of the variable in question, the second is the minimum
	lag to be used as an instrument, and the third is the maximum lag.
	The same syntax can be used with the <lit>GMMlevel</lit>
	function to specify GMM-type instruments for the equations
	in levels.
      </para>
      <para context="gui">
	As regards the handling of instruments, please see the
	documentation for the script version of this command.  Currently
	you cannot specify instruments explicitly in the GUI: all the
	independent variables are taken to be strictly exogenous.
      </para>
      <para>
	By default the results of 1-step estimation are reported (with
	robust standard errors).  You may select 2-step estimation as an
	option.  In both cases tests for autocorrelation of orders 1 and 2
	are provided, as well as the Sargan overidentification test and a
	Wald test for the joint significance of the regressors.  Note that
	in this differenced model first-order autocorrelation is not a
	threat to the validity of the model, but second-order
	autocorrelation violates the maintained statistical assumptions.
      </para>
      <para context="cli">
	In the case of 2-step estimation, standard errors are by default
	computed using the finite-sample correction suggested by <cite
	key="windmeijer05">Windmeijer (2005)</cite>.  The standard
	asymptotic standard errors associated with the 2-step estimator
	are generally reckoned to be an unreliable guide to inference, but
	if for some reason you want to see them you can use the
	<opt>asymptotic</opt> option to turn off the Windmeijer
	correction.
      </para>
      <para context="cli">
	If the <opt>time-dummies</opt> option is given, a set of
	time dummy variables is added to the specified regressors.  
	The number of dummies is one less than the maximum number of
	periods used in estimation, to avoid perfect collinearity with
	the constant.  The dummies are entered in differenced form unless
	the <opt>dpdstyle</opt> option is given, in which case they
	are entered in levels.

    label="Create sets of dummies">

    <description>
      <para>
	The <quote>dummify</quote> operation is available only
	for discrete-valued series. Its effect is to create a
	set of dummy variables coding for the distinct values
	present in the series.
      </para>
      <para>
	For example suppose one has a series named <lit>race</lit>,
	with values 1 for <quote>white</quote>, 2 for
	<quote>black</quote>, 3 for <quote>hispanic</quote> and 4 for
	<quote>other</quote>. To dummify this series means to create 4
	dummy variables: the first has value 1 for all observations at
	which race = 1, zero otherwise; the second has value 1 for all
	observations at which race = 2, zero otherwise; and so on.
      </para>
      <para>
	In practice it's likely that for a discrete series with
	<math>k</math> categories you will want to create only
	<math>k</math> &minus; 1 dummies, to avoid falling into
	the so-called <quote>dummy variable trap</quote>. Hence you

	highest value from the coding.

      <para>
	For any suitable variables in <repl>varlist</repl>, creates a set
	of dummy variables coding for the distinct values of that
	variable.   Suitable variables are those that have been explicitly
	marked as discrete, or those that take on a fairly small number of
	values all of which are <quote>fairly round</quote> (multiples of
	0.25).
      </para>
      <para>
	By default a dummy variable is added for each distinct value of
	the variable in question.  For example if a discrete variable
	<lit>x</lit> has 5 distinct values, 5 dummy variables will be
	added to the data set, with names <lit>Dx_1</lit>, <lit>Dx_2</lit>
	and so on.  The first dummy variable will have value 1 for
	observations where <lit>x</lit> takes on its smallest value, 0
	otherwise; the next dummy will have value 1 when <lit>x</lit>
	takes on its second-smallest value, and so on.  If one of the
	option flags <opt>drop-first</opt> or <opt>drop-last</opt>
	is added, then either the lowest or the highest value of each
	variable is omitted from the encoding (which may be useful for
	avoiding the <quote>dummy variable trap</quote>).

  <command name="expand" section="Dataset" context="gui"
    label="Expand data">

    <description>
      <para>
	If you wish to add to a dataset a series that is of lower
	frequency, it is necessary to <quote>expand</quote> the new
	series.  For instance, a quarterly series will have to be expanded
	to fit into a monthly dataset. In addition, you may sometimes want
	to expand an entire dataset to a higher frequency (perhaps, prior
	to adding a higher-frequency variable to the dataset).
      </para>
      <para>
	Expansion of data should be considered an
	<quote>expert</quote> option; you need to know what you are
	doing. When combining series of differing original frequencies
	within one dataset, you should probably consider compacting
	the higher-frequency data rather than expanding the
	lower-frequency series.
      </para>
      <para>
	That said, gretl offers two options: higher-frequency values
	can be interpolated using the method of <cite
	key="chowlin71">Chow and Lin (1971)</cite>, or the values of
	the lower-frequency series can be repeated as many times as
	required.
      </para>
      <para>
	The Chow&ndash;Lin method is regression-based, using a constant and
	quadratic trend and assuming a first-order autoregressive
	process for the disturbances. Four degrees of freedom are used
	up by this procedure.
      </para>
      <para>
	As for the repetition of values, suppose we have a quarterly
	series with the value 35.5 in 1990:1, the first quarter of
	1990.  On expansion to monthly, the value 35.5 will be
	assigned to the observations for January, February and March
	of 1990.  The expanded variable is therefore useless for
	fine-grained time-series analysis, outside of the special case
	where you know that the variable in question does in fact
	remain constant over the sub-periods.

      </para>

      <para context="cli">
	Must follow an estimation command.  Forecasts are generated for a
	certain range of observations: if <repl>startobs</repl> and
	<repl>endobs</repl> are given, for that range (if possible); otherwise
	if the <opt>out-of-sample</opt> option is given, for observations
	following the range over which the model was estimated; otherwise over
	the currently defined sample range.  If an out-of-sample forecast is
	requested but no relevant observations are available, an error is
	flagged. Depending on the nature of the model, standard errors may
	also be generated; see below.  Also see below for the special effect
	of the <opt>rolling</opt> option.
      </para>

      <para context="cli">
	If the last model estimated is a single equation, then the
	optional <repl>vname</repl> argument has the following effect:
	the forecast values are not printed, but are saved to the dataset
	under the given name.  If the last model is a system of equations,
	<repl>vname</repl> has a different effect, namely selecting a
	particular endogenous variable for forecasting (the default being
	to produce forecasts for all the endogenous variables). In the
	system case, or if <repl>vname</repl> is not given, the forecast
	values can be retrieved using the accessor <lit>$fcast</lit>, and
	the standard errors, if available, via <lit>$fcerr</lit>.
      </para>

      <para>
	The choice between a static and a dynamic forecast applies
	only in the case of dynamic models, with an autoregressive
	error process or including one or more lagged values of the
	dependent variable as regressors.  Static forecasts are one
	step ahead, based on realized values from the previous period,
	while dynamic forecasts employ the chain rule of forecasting.
	For example, if a forecast for <math>y</math> in 2008
	requires as input a value of <math>y</math> for 2007, a
	static forecast is impossible without actual data for 2007.  A
	dynamic forecast for 2008 is possible if a prior forecast can
	be substituted for <math>y</math> in 2007.
      </para>

      <para>
	The default is to give a static forecast for any portion of
	the forecast range that lies within the sample range over which
	the model was estimated, and a dynamic forecast (if relevant)
	out of sample.  The <opt>dynamic</opt> option requests a
	dynamic forecast from the earliest possible date, and the
	<opt>static</opt> option requests a static forecast even out
	of sample.  
      </para>

      <para context="cli">
	The <opt>rolling</opt> option is presently available only for
	single-equation models estimated via OLS.  When this option is given
	the forecasts are recursive. That is, each forecast is generated from
	an estimate of the given model using data from a fixed starting point
	(namely, the start of the sample range for the original estimation) up
	to the forecast date minus <math>k</math>, where <math>k</math> is the
	number of steps ahead, which must be given in the
	<repl>steps-ahead</repl> argument. The forecasts are always dynamic if
	this is applicable.  Note that the <repl>steps-ahead</repl> argument
	should be given only in conjunction with the <opt>rolling</opt>
	option.
      </para>

      <para context="cli">
	The <opt>plot</opt> option (available only in the case of
	single-equation estimation) calls for a plot file to be
	produced, containing a graphical representation of the
	forecast. The suffix of the <repl>filename</repl> argument to
	this option controls the format of the plot: <lit>.eps</lit>
	for EPS, <lit>.pdf</lit> for PDF, <lit>.png</lit> for PNG,
	<lit>.plt</lit> for a gnuplot command file. The dummy filename
	<lit>display</lit> can be used to force display of the plot in
	a window. For example,
      </para>
      <code>
	fcast --plot=fc.pdf
      </code>
      <para>
	will generate a graphic in PDF format.  Absolute pathnames are
	respected, otherwise files are written to the gretl working
	directory.
      </para>
      <para>
	The nature of the forecast standard errors (if available) depends
	on the nature of the model and the forecast.  For static linear
	models standard errors are computed using the method outlined by
	<cite key="davidson-mackinnon04">Davidson and MacKinnon
	(2004)</cite>; they incorporate both uncertainty due to the error
	process and parameter uncertainty (summarized in the covariance
	matrix of the parameter estimates).  For dynamic models, forecast
	standard errors are computed only in the case of a dynamic
	forecast, and they do not incorporate parameter uncertainty.  For
	nonlinear models, forecast standard errors are not presently
	available.

  <command name="flush" section="Programming" context="cli">

    <description>
     <para>
       This simple command (no arguments, no options) is intended for
       use in time-consuming scripts that may be executed via the
       gretl GUI (it is ignored by the command-line program), to give
       the user a visual indication that things are moving along and
       gretl is not <quote>frozen</quote>.
     </para>
     <para>
       Ordinarily if you launch a script in the GUI no output is shown
       until its execution is completed, but the effect of invoking
       <lit>flush</lit> is as follows:
     </para>
     <ilist>
       <li>
	 <para>
	   On the first invocation, gretl opens a window, displays the
	   output so far, and appends the message
	   <quote>Processing...</quote>.
	 </para>
       </li>
       <li>
	 <para>
	   On subsequent invocations the text shown in the output
	   window is updated, and a new <quote>processing</quote>
	   message is appended.
	 </para>
       </li>
     </ilist>
     <para>
       When execution of the script is completed any remaining output
       is automatically flushed to the text window.
     </para>
     <para>
       Please note, there is no point in using <lit>flush</lit> in
       scripts that take less than (say) 5 seconds to execute. Also
       note that this command should not be used at a point in the
       script where there is no further output to be printed, as the
       <quote>processing</quote> message will then be misleading
       to the user.
     </para>
     <para>
       The following illustrates the intended use of <lit>flush</lit>:
     </para>
     <code>
       set echo off
       scalar n = 10
       loop i=1..n
           # do some time-consuming operation
           loop 100 --quiet
               a = mnormal(200,200)
               b = inv(a)
           endloop
           # print some results
           printf "Iteration %2d done\n", i
           if i &lt; n

	A <lit>genr</lit> command may yield either a series or a scalar

      </para>

      <ilist>
	<li>
	  <para>
	    <cmd>genr time</cmd> creates a time trend variable (1,2,3,&hellip;)
	    called <cmd>time</cmd>. <cmd>genr index</cmd> does the same thing
	    except that the variable is called <lit>index</lit>.
	  </para>
	</li>
	<li>
	  <para>
	    <cmd>genr dummy</cmd> creates dummy variables up to the periodicity
	    of the data.  In the case of quarterly data
	    (periodicity 4), the program creates <lit>dq1</lit> = 1 for
	    first quarter and 0 in other quarters, <lit>dq2</lit> = 1 for
	    the second quarter and 0 in other quarters, and so on.  With
	    monthly data the dummies are named <lit>dm1</lit>, <lit>dm2</lit>,
	    and so on.  With other frequencies the names are
	    <lit>dummy_1</lit>, <lit>dummy_2</lit>, etc.
	  </para>
	</li>
	<li>
	  <para>
	    <cmd>genr unitdum</cmd> and <cmd>genr timedum</cmd> create 
	    sets of special dummy variables for use with panel data.
	    The first codes for the cross-sectional units and the second
	    for the time period of the observations.
	  </para>
	</li>
      </ilist>

      <para>
	<emphasis>Note</emphasis>: In the command-line program,
	<cmd>genr</cmd> commands that retrieve model-related data
	always reference the model that was estimated most
	recently. This is also true in the GUI program, if one uses
	<cmd>genr</cmd> in the <quote>gretl console</quote> or enters
	a formula using the <quote>Define new variable</quote> option
	under the Add menu in the main window.  With the GUI, however,
	you have the option of retrieving data from any model
	currently displayed in a window (whether or not it's the most
	recent model).  You do this under the <quote>Save</quote> menu
	in the model's window.
      </para>

      <para>
	The special variable <lit>obs</lit> serves as an index of the
	observations.  For instance <lit>series dum = (obs=15)</lit> will
	generate a dummy variable that has value 1 for observation 15, 0
	otherwise.  You can also use this variable to pick out particular
	observations by date or name.  For example, 
	<lit>series d = (obs&gt;1986:4)</lit>, 
	<lit>series d = (obs&gt;"2008-04-01")</lit>, or
	<lit>series d = (obs="CA")</lit>.  If daily dates or observation labels
	are used in this context, they should be enclosed in double quotes.
	Quarterly and monthly dates (with a colon) may be used unquoted. Note
	that in the case of annual time series data, the year is not
	distinguishable syntactically from a plain integer; therefore if you
	wish to compare observations against <lit>obs</lit> by year you must
	use the function <lit>obsnum</lit> to convert the year to a 1-based
	index value, as in <lit>series d = (obs&gt;obsnum(1986))</lit>.
      </para>

      <para>
	Scalar values can be pulled from a series in the context of a
	<lit>genr</lit> formula, using the syntax
	<repl>varname</repl><lit>[</lit><repl>obs</repl><lit>]</lit>. The
	<repl>obs</repl> value can be given by number or date. Examples:
	<lit>x[5]</lit>, <lit>CPI[1996:01]</lit>.  For daily data, the form
	<repl>YYYY-MM-DD</repl> should be used, &eg; <lit>ibm[1970-01-23]</lit>.
      </para>

      <para>
	An individual observation in a series can be modified via
	<lit>genr</lit>.  To do this, a valid observation number or date, in
	square brackets, must be appended to the name of the variable on the
	left-hand side of the formula.  For example, <lit>genr x[3] = 30</lit>
	or <lit>genr x[1950:04] = 303.7</lit>.

    <description>
      <para>
	The variables in the list <repl>yvars</repl> are graphed
	against <repl>xvar</repl>.  For a time series plot you may
	either give <lit>time</lit> as <repl>xvar</repl> or use the
	option flag <opt>time-series</opt>.
      </para>
      <para>
	By default, data-points are shown as points; this can be
	overridden by giving one of the options
	<opt>with-lines</opt>, <opt>with-lp</opt> or
	<opt>with-impulses</opt>. If more than one variable is to be
	plotted on the <math>y</math> axis, the effect of these
	options may be confined to a subset of the variables by using
	the <repl>varspec</repl> parameter. This should take the form
	of a comma-separated listing of the names or numbers of the
	variables to be plotted with lines or impulses
	respectively. For instance, the final example above shows how
	to plot <lit>y1</lit> and <lit>y2</lit> against <lit>x</lit>,
	such that <lit>y2</lit> is represented by a line but
	<lit>y1</lit> by points.
      </para>
      <para>
	If the <opt>dummy</opt> option is selected, exactly three
	variables should be given: a single <math>y</math> variable, an
	<math>x</math> variable, and <repl>dvar</repl>, a discrete
	variable.  The effect is to plot <repl>yvar</repl> against
	<repl>xvar</repl> with the points shown in different colors
	depending on the value of <repl>dvar</repl> at the given
	observation.
      </para>
      <subhead>Taking data from a matrix</subhead>
      <para>
	Generally, the arguments <repl>yvars</repl> and
	<repl>xvar</repl> are required, and refer to series in the
	current dataset (given either by name or ID number).  But if a
	named matrix is supplied via the <opt>matrix</opt> option
	these arguments become optional: if the specified matrix has
	<math>k</math> columns, by default the first <math>k</math>
	&minus; 1 columns are treated as the <repl>yvars</repl> and
	the last column as <repl>xvar</repl>.  If the
	<opt>time-series</opt> option is given, however, all
	<math>k</math> columns are plotted against time. If you wish
	to plot selected columns of the matrix, you should specify
	<repl>yvars</repl> and <repl>xvar</repl> in the form of
	1-based column numbers.  For example if you want a scatterplot
	of column 2 of matrix <lit>M</lit> against column 1, you can
	do:
      </para>
      <code>
	gnuplot 2 1 --matrix=M
      </code>
      <subhead>Showing a line of best fit</subhead>
      <para>
	The <opt>fit</opt> option is applicable only for bivariate
	scatterplots and single time-series plots. The default
	behavior for a scatterplot is to show the OLS fit if the slope
	coefficient is significant at the 10 percent level, while the
	default behavior for time-series is not to show any fitted
	line.  You can call for different behavior by using this
	option along with one of the following <repl>fitspec</repl>
	parameter values. Note that if the plot is a single time
	series the place of <math>x</math> is taken by time.
      </para>
      <ilist>
	<li>
	  <para>
	    <lit>linear</lit>: show the OLS fit regardless of its
	    level of statistical significance.
	  </para>
	</li>
	<li>
	  <para>
	    <lit>none</lit>: don't show any fitted line.
	  </para>
	</li>
	<li>
	  <para>
	    <lit>inverse</lit>, <lit>quadratic</lit>,
	    <lit>cubic</lit>, <lit>semilog</lit> or <lit>linlog</lit>:
	    show a fitted line based on a regression of the specified
	    type. By <lit>semilog</lit>, we mean a regression of log
	    <math>y</math> on <math>x</math>; the fitted line
	    represents the conditional expectation of <math>y</math>,
	    obtained by exponentiation. By <lit>linlog</lit> we mean a
	    regression of <math>y</math> on the log of <math>x</math>.
	  </para>
	</li>
	<li>
	  <para>
	    <lit>loess</lit>: show the fit from a robust locally
	    weighted regression (also is sometimes known as
	    <quote>lowess</quote>).
	  </para>
	</li>	
      </ilist>
      <subhead>Plotting a band</subhead>
      <para>
	The <opt>band</opt> option can be used for plotting zero or
	more series along with a <quote>band</quote> of some sort
	(typically representing a confidence interval). This option
	requires two comma-separated parameters: the name or ID number
	of a series representing the center of the band, and the name
	or ID of a series giving the width of the band: the effect is
	to draw a band with <math>y</math> coordinates equal to center
	minus width and center plus width. An optional third parameter
	(again, comma-separated) can be used to give a multiplier for
	the width dimension, in the form of a numerical constant or
	the name of a scalar variable. So for example, the following
	example plots <lit>y</lit> along with a band of plus or minus
	1.96 times <lit>se_y</lit>:
      </para>
      <code>
	gnuplot y --band=y,se_y,1.96 --with-lines
      </code>
      <para>
	When the <opt>band</opt> option is given, the companion option
	<opt>band-style</opt> can be used to control the band's
	representation. By default the upper and lower limits are
	shown as solid lines, but the parameters <lit>fill</lit> or
	<lit>dash</lit> cause the band to be drawn as a shaded area or
	using dashed lines, respectively.  In addition a color
	specification can be appended (following a comma) or
	substituted. Here are some style examples:
      </para>
      <code>
	gnuplot ... --band-style=fill
	gnuplot ... --band-style=dash,0xbbddff
	gnuplot ... --band-style=,black
      </code>
      <para>
	The first example produces a shaded area in the default color;
	the second switches to dashed lines with a specified blue-gray
	color; and the third uses solid black lines. Note that colors
	can be given as either hexadecimal RGB values or by name; you
	can access the list of color-names recognized by gnuplot by
	issuing the command <quote><lit>show colornames</lit></quote>
	in gnuplot itself, or in the gretl console by doing
      </para>
      <code>
	eval readfile("@gretldir/data/gnuplot/gpcolors.txt")
      </code>
      <subhead>Controlling the output</subhead>
      <para>
	In interactive mode the plot is displayed immediately. In
	batch mode the default behavior is that a gnuplot command file
	is written in the user's working directory, with a name on the
	pattern <filename>gpttmpN.plt</filename>, starting with N =
	<lit>01</lit>. The actual plots may be generated later using
	<program>gnuplot</program> (under MS Windows,
	<program>wgnuplot</program>).  This behavior can be modified
	by use of the <opt>output=</opt><repl>filename</repl>
	option.  This option controls the filename used, and at the
	same time allows you to specify a particular output format via
	the three-letter extension of the file name, as follows:
	<lit>.eps</lit> results in the production of an Encapsulated
	PostScript (EPS) file; <lit>.pdf</lit> produces PDF;
	<lit>.png</lit> produces PNG format, <lit>.emf</lit> calls for
	EMF (Enhanced MetaFile), <lit>.fig</lit> calls for an Xfig
	file, and <lit>.svg</lit> for SVG (Scalable Vector
	Graphics). If the dummy filename
	<quote><lit>display</lit></quote> is given then the plot is
	shown on screen as in interactive mode. If a filename with any
	extension other than those just mentioned is given, a gnuplot
	command file is written.
      </para>
      <subhead>Adding gnuplot commands</subhead>
      <para>
	A further option to this command is available: following the
	specification of the variables to be plotted and the option
	flag (if any), you may add literal gnuplot commands to control
	the appearance of the plot (for example, setting the plot
	title and/or the axis ranges).  These commands should be
	enclosed in braces, and each gnuplot command must be
	terminated with a semi-colon.  A backslash may be used to
	continue a set of gnuplot commands over more than one line.
	Here is an example of the syntax:
      </para>
      <code>
	{ set title 'My Title'; set yrange [0:1000]; }
      </code>

	Gretl calls a separate program, namely gnuplot, to generate
	graphs.  Gnuplot is a very full-featured graphing program with
	myriad options.  Gretl gives you direct access, via a
	graphical interface, to a subset of these options and it tries
	to choose sensible values for you; it also allows you to take
	complete control over graph details if you wish.

    <description>
      <para>
	Gretl's test calculator computes test statistics and p-values for
	various common hypothesis tests concerning one or two populations.  The
	required input takes the form of sample statistics derived from one or
	two samples, depending on the test chosen.  These statistics can be
	typed in as numerical values.  Alternatively, if you have a data file
	open, you can get gretl to calculate sample statistics for a selected
	variable or variables (in the case of means and variances, but not in
	the case of proportions).
      </para>

      <para>
	If you want to base your test on a variable in the data set, first
	activate this option by checking the box titled "Use variable from
	dataset".  Then the drop-down list of variables will become active and
	you can select a variable.  When you select a variable from the list,
	the relevant statistics are automatically entered in the boxes below.
      </para>

      <para>
	In addition to the simple selection of a variable, you have the option
	of specifying a restriction on the selected variable (that is, defining
	a sub-sample).   For example, suppose you have wage data in a variable
	called "wage" and you also have a dummy variable called "gender" that
	equals 1 for males and 0 for females (or vice versa). Then, in the test
	for the difference of two means, you could select "wage" in both slots,
	but add to the top slot "(gender=0)" and to the bottom "(gender=1)".
	This would then give you a test for the difference between mean male
	income and mean female income.  Note that when you type a restriction in
	this way, you must then press the Enter key to have the sample statistics
	calculated.  
      </para>

      <para>
	The sub-sampling restriction must be placed in parentheses following the
	selected variable, and in general the restriction takes the form "var2
	op value," where var2 is the name of a variable in the current data set,
	val is a numerical value, and op is a comparison operator chosen from =,
	!=, &lt;, &gt;, &lt;= or &gt;= (respectively equality, inequality, less
	than, greater than, less than or equal, and greater than or equal).  The
	spaces around the operator are optional.

	<math>x</math> and <math>y</math>, are drawn randomly
	from the same distribution, the probability that
	<math>x</math><sub>i</sub> &gt;
	<math>y</math><sub>i</sub>, for each observation
	<math>i</math>, should equal 0.5.  The test statistic is
	<math>w</math>, the number of observations for which
	<math>x</math><sub>i</sub> &gt;
	<math>y</math><sub>i</sub>. Under the null hypothesis this
	follows the Binomial distribution with parameters
	(<math>n</math>, 0.5), where <math>n</math> is the
	number of observations.
      </para>
      <para>
	Rank sum test: The Wilcoxon rank-sum test is performed.  This test
	proceeds by ranking the observations from both samples jointly,
	from smallest to largest, then finding the sum of the ranks of the
	observations from one of the samples.  The two samples do not have
	to be of the same size, and if they differ the smaller sample is
	used in calculating the rank-sum.  Under the null hypothesis that
	the samples are drawn from populations with the same median, the
	probability distribution of the rank-sum can be computed for any
	given sample sizes; and for reasonably large samples a close
	Normal approximation exists.
      </para>
      <para>
	Signed rank test: The Wilcoxon signed-rank test is performed.
	This is designed for matched data pairs such as, for example, the
	values of a variable for a sample of individuals before and after
	some treatment.  The test proceeds by finding the differences
	between the paired observations, <math>x</math><sub>i</sub>
	&minus; <math>y</math><sub>i</sub>, ranking these
	differences by absolute value, then assigning to each pair a
	signed rank, the sign agreeing with the sign of the difference.
	One then calculates <math>W</math><sub>+</sub>, the sum of
	the positive signed ranks.  As with the rank-sum test, this
	statistic has a well-defined distribution under the null that the
	median difference is zero, which converges to the Normal for
	samples of reasonable size.
      </para>
      <para>
	Under the <quote>Runs test</quote> tab you can carry out a test
	for the randomness of a given variable, based on the number of
	runs of consecutive positive or negative values.  If you select
	the option <quote>Use first difference</quote>, the variable is
	differenced prior to the analysis and hence the runs are
	interpreted as runs of increasing or decreasing values of the
	original variable.  The test statistic is based on a normal
	approximation to the distribution of the number of runs under
	the null of randomness.

  <command name="hausman" section="Tests" label="Panel diagnostics">

    <description>
      <para>
	This test is available only after estimating an OLS model
	using panel data (see also <cmd>setobs</cmd>).  It tests the
	simple pooled model against the principal alternatives, the fixed
	effects and random effects models.
      </para>

      <para>
	The fixed effects model allows the intercept of the regression to
	vary across the cross-sectional units.  An
	<math>F</math>-test is reported for the null hypotheses that
	the intercepts do not differ. The random effects model decomposes
	the residual variance into two parts, one part specific to the
	cross-sectional unit and the other specific to the particular
	observation.  (This estimator can be computed only if the number
	of cross-sectional units in the data set exceeds the number of
	parameters to be estimated.) The Breusch&ndash;Pagan LM statistic
	tests the null hypothesis that the pooled OLS estimator is
	adequate against the random effects alternative.
      </para>

      <para>
	The pooled OLS model may be rejected against both of the
	alternatives, fixed effects and random effects. Provided the
	unit- or group-specific error is uncorrelated with the
	independent variables, the random effects estimator is more
	efficient than the fixed effects estimator; otherwise the
	random effects estimator is inconsistent and the fixed effects
	estimator is to be preferred. The null hypothesis for the
	Hausman test is that the group-specific error is not so
	correlated (and therefore the random effects model is
	preferable).  A low p-value for this test counts against the
	random effects model and in favor of fixed effects.

	Calculates the Hurst exponent (a measure of persistence or
	long memory) for a time-series variable having at least 128
	observations.
      </para>
      <para>
	The Hurst exponent is discussed by <cite
	key="mandelbrot83">Mandelbrot (1983)</cite>.  In theoretical
	terms it is the exponent, <math>H</math>, in the relationship
	<equation status="display"
		  tex="\[\mathrm{RS}(x) = an^H\]"
		  ascii="RS(x) = an^H" graphic="hurst"/> where RS is the
	<quote>rescaled range</quote> of the variable <math>x</math>
	in samples of size <math>n</math> and <math>a</math> is a
	constant. The rescaled range is the range (maximum minus
	minimum) of the cumulated value or partial sum of
	<math>x</math> over the sample period (after subtraction of
	the sample mean), divided by the sample standard deviation.
      </para>
      <para>
	As a reference point, if <math>x</math> is white noise
	(zero mean, zero persistence) then the range of its cumulated
	<quote>wandering</quote> (which forms a random walk), scaled
	by the standard deviation, grows as the square root of the
	sample size, giving an expected Hurst exponent of 0.5.  Values
	of the exponent significantly in excess of 0.5 indicate
	persistence, and values less than 0.5 indicate
	anti-persistence (negative autocorrelation).  In principle the
	exponent is bounded by 0 and 1, although in finite samples it
	is possible to get an estimated exponent greater than 1.  
      </para>
      <para>
	In gretl, the exponent is estimated using binary sub-sampling:
	we start with the entire data range, then the two halves of
	the range, then the four quarters, and so on.  For sample
	sizes smaller than the data range, the RS value is the mean
	across the available samples.  The exponent is then estimated
	as the slope coefficient in a regression of the log of RS on
	the log of sample size.
      </para>
      <para>
	By default, if the program is not in batch mode a plot of the
	rescaled range is shown.  This can be adjusted via the
	<opt>plot</opt> option. The acceptable parameters to this
	option are <lit>none</lit> (to suppress the plot);
	<lit>display</lit> (to display a plot even when in batch
	mode); or a file name. The effect of providing a file name is
	as described for the <opt>output</opt> option of the <cmdref
	targ="gnuplot"/> command.

    <description>
      <para>
	If you select the bootstrap option when plotting impulse
	responses, gretl computes a confidence interval for the responses
	using the bootstrap method.  The residuals from the original VAR
	(or VECM) are resampled with replacement; an artificial dataset is
	constructed based on the original parameter estimates and the
	resampled residuals; the system is re-estimated and the impulse
	responses are re-evaluated.  This is repeated 999 times and the
	&alpha;/2 and 1 &minus; &alpha;/2 quantiles for the responses are
	found and plotted along with the point estimates. This option is
	not currently available for restricted VECMs.
      </para>
      <para>
	This dialog also supports reordering of the variables for the
	Cholesky decomposition of the cross-equation covariance matrix.
	The default is given by the order in which the variables are
	entered into the model specification, but the up and down arrows
	can be used to promote or demote a selected variable.

	If the dependent variable is a binary variable (all values are 0
	or 1) maximum likelihood estimates of the coefficients on
	<repl>indepvars</repl> are obtained via the Newton&ndash;Raphson
	method. As the model is nonlinear the slopes depend on the
	values of the independent variables.  By default the slopes with
	respect to each of the independent variables are calculated (at
	the means of those variables) and these slopes replace the usual
	p-values in the regression output.  This behavior can be
	suppressed my giving the <opt>p-values</opt> option. The
	chi-square statistic tests the null hypothesis that all
	coefficients are zero apart from the constant.

      <para>
	Performs Maximum Likelihood (ML) estimation using either the
	BFGS (Broyden, Fletcher, Goldfarb, Shanno) algorithm or
	Newton's method. You must specify the log-likelihood function;
	it is recommended that you also supply expressions for the
	derivatives of this function with respect to each of the
	parameters if possible.
      </para>
      <para>
	Simple example: Suppose we have a series <lit>X</lit> with values 0
	or 1 and we wish to obtain the maximum likelihood estimate of the
	probability, <lit>p</lit>, that <lit>X</lit> = 1.  (In this simple case
	we can guess in advance that the ML estimate of <lit>p</lit> will simply
	equal the proportion of Xs equal to 1 in the sample.)
      </para>
      <para>
	The parameter <lit>p</lit> must first be added to the dataset and
	given an initial value.  This can be done using the genr command or via
	menu choices.  Appropriate <quote>genr</quote> lines may be typed into
	the MLE specification window prior to the specification of the
	log-likelihood function.
      </para>
      <para>
	In the MLE window we type the following lines:
      </para>
      <code>
	loglik = X*log(p) + (1-X)*log(1-p)
	deriv p = X/p - (1-X)/(1-p)
      </code>
      <para>
	The first line specifies the log-likelihood function, and the
	next line supplies the derivative of that function with
	respect to the parameter p.  If no "deriv" lines are given, a
	numerical approximation to the derivatives is computed.
      </para>
      <para>
	If the parameter p was not previously declared we could
	preface the above lines with something like the following:
      </para>
      <code>
	scalar p = 0.5
      </code>
      <para>
	By default, standard errors are based on the Outer Product of the
	Gradient.  If the robust standard errors box is checked, a QML
	estimator is used (namely, a sandwich of the negative inverse of
	the Hessian and the covariance matrix of the gradient).  The
	Hessian is approximated numerically.
      </para>

      <para>
	The first line above specifies the log-likelihood function. It
	starts with the keyword <lit>mle</lit>, then a dependent
	variable is specified and an expression for the log-likelihood
	is given (using the same syntax as in the <cmd>genr</cmd>
	command).  The next line (which is optional) starts with the
	keyword <lit>deriv</lit> and supplies the derivative of the
	log-likelihood function with respect to the parameter
	<lit>p</lit>. If no derivatives are given, you should include
	a statement using the keyword <lit>params</lit> which
	identifies the free parameters: these are listed on one line,
	separated by spaces and can be either scalars, or vectors, or
	any combination of the two.  For example, the above could be
	changed to:
      </para>
      <code>
	mle loglik = X*log(p) + (1-X)*log(1-p)
	  params p
	end mle
      </code>
      <para>
	in which case numerical derivatives would be used.

      <para>
	Note that any option flags should be appended to the ending line
	of the MLE block.
      </para>
      <para>
	By default, estimated standard errors are based on the Outer
	Product of the Gradient.  If the <opt>hessian</opt> option is
	given, they are instead based on the negative inverse of the

	<opt>robust</opt> option is given, a QML estimator is used
	(namely, a sandwich of the negative inverse of the Hessian and the
	covariance matrix of the gradient). 
      </para>
      <para>
	If you supply analytical derivatives, by default gretl runs a
	numerical check on their plausibility.  Occasionally this may
	produce false positives, instances where correct derivatives
	appear to be wrong and estimation is refused. To counter this,
	or to achieve a little extra speed, you can give the option
	<opt>no-gradient-check</opt>.  Obviously, you should do this
	only if you are confident that the gradient you have specified
	is right.
      </para>
      <subhead>Parameter names</subhead>
      <para>
	In estimating a nonlinear model it is often convenient to name
	the parameters tersely. In printing the results, however, it
	may be desirable to use more informative labels. This can be
	achieved via the additional keyword <lit>param_names</lit>
	within the command block. For a model with <math>k</math>
	parameters the argument following this keyword should be
	either a double-quoted string literal holding <math>k</math>
	space-separated names or the name of a string variable that
	holds <math>k</math> such names.

	In econometric research it is common to estimate several
	models with a common dependent variable&mdash;the models
	differing in respect of which independent variables are
	included, or perhaps in respect of the estimator used.  In
	this situation it is convenient to present the regression
	results in the form of a table, where each column contains the
	results (coefficient estimates and standard errors) for a
	given model, and each row contains the estimates for a given
	variable across the models.
      </para>

      <para>
	Gretl provides a means of constructing such a table (and
	copying it in plain text, &latex; or Rich Text Format).  Here is
	how to do it:

	<li><para>Estimate a model which you wish to include in the
	    table, and in the model display window, under the File

	    <quote>Save as icon and close</quote>.</para>
	</li>
	<li><para>Repeat step 1 for the other models to be included in
	    the table (up to a total of six models).</para>

	      view</quote> icon on the gretl toolbar).</para>
	</li>
	<li><para>In session icon view, there is an icon labeled
	    <quote>Model table</quote>. Decide which model you wish to
	    appear in the left-most column of the model table and add

	    Model table icon, or by right-clicking on the model icon
	    and selecting <quote>Add to model table</quote> from the
	    pop-up menu.</para>
	</li>
	<li><para>Repeat step 4 for the other models you wish to

	    on.</para>
	</li>
	<li><para>When you are finished composing the model table,
	    display it by double-clicking on its icon.  Under the Edit

	<li><para>If the ordering of the models in the table is not

      <para>
	Must immediately follow an estimation command. Depending on
	the option given, this command carries out one of the
	following: the Doornik&ndash;Hansen test for the normality of
	the error term; a Lagrange Multiplier test for nonlinearity
	(logs or squares); White's test (with or without
	cross-products) or the Breusch&ndash;Pagan test (<cite
	key="breusch-pagan79">Breusch and Pagan, 1979</cite>) for
	heteroskedasticity; the LMF test for serial correlation <cite
	key="kiviet86" p="true">(Kiviet, 1986)</cite>; a test for ARCH
	(Autoregressive Conditional Heteroskedasticity; see also the
	<cmd>arch</cmd> command); or a test of the common factor
	restriction implied by AR(1) estimation.  With the exception
	of the normality and common factor test most of the options
	are only available for models estimated via OLS, but see below
	for details regarding two-stage least squares.
      </para>
      <para>
	The optional <lit>order</lit> argument is relevant only in case
	the <opt>autocorr</opt> or <opt>arch</opt> options are
	selected.  The default is to run these tests using a lag order
	equal to the periodicity of the data, but this can be adjusted by
	supplying a specific lag order.
      </para>
      <para>
	The <opt>robust</opt> option applies only when the
	Breusch&ndash;Pagan test is selected; its effect is to use the
	robust variance estimator proposed by <cite
	key="koenker81">Koenker (1981)</cite>, making the test less
	sensitive to the assumption of normality.
      </para>
      <para>
	The <opt>panel</opt> option is available only when the model
	is estimated on panel data: in this case a test for groupwise
	heteroskedasticity is performed (that is, for a differing
	error variance across the cross-sectional units).
      </para>
      <para>
	The <opt>comfac</opt> option is available only when the model is
	estimated via an AR(1) method such as Hildreth&ndash;Lu.  The
	auxiliary regression takes the form of a relatively unrestricted
	dynamic model, which is used to test the common factor restriction
	implicit in the AR(1) specification.
      </para>
      <para>
	By default, the program prints the auxiliary regression on
	which the test statistic is based, where applicable.  This may
	be suppressed by using the <opt>quiet</opt> flag (minimal
	printed output) or the <opt>silent</opt> flag (no printed
	output).  The test statistic and its p-value may be retrieved
	using the accessors <fncref targ="$test"/> and <fncref
	targ="$pvalue"/> respectively.
      </para>
      <para>
	When a model has been estimated by two-stage least squares (see
	<cmdref targ="tsls"/>), the LM principle breaks down and gretl
	offers some equivalents: the <flag>--autocorr</flag> option
	computes Godfrey's test for autocorrelation <cite key="godfrey94"
	p="true">(Godfrey, 1994)</cite> while the <flag>--white</flag>
	option yields the HET1 heteroskedasticity test <cite
	key="pesaran99" p="true">(Pesaran and Taylor, 1999)</cite>.

      <para>
	Estimates a Negative Binomial model.  The dependent variable is taken
	to represent a count of the occurrence of events of some sort, and
	must have only non-negative integer values. By default the model
	NegBin 2 is used, in which the conditional variance of the count is
	given by &mu;(1 + &alpha;&mu;), where &mu; denotes the conditional
	mean.  But if the <opt>model1</opt> option is given the conditional
	variance is &mu;(1 + &alpha;).

	The optional <lit>offset</lit> series works in the same way as for the

	By default, standard errors are computed using a numerical

      <para>
	Performs Nonlinear Least Squares (NLS) estimation using a
	modified version of the Levenberg&ndash;Marquardt
	algorithm. You must supply a function specification; it is
	recommended but not required that you also supply expressions
	for the derivatives of this function with respect to each of
	the parameters if possible.  If you do not supply derivatives
	you should instead give a list of the parameters to be
	estimated (separated by spaces or commas), preceded by the
	keyword <lit>params</lit>; these can be either scalars, or
	vectors, or any combination of the two.
      </para>
      <para>
	Example: Suppose we have a data set with variables
	<math>C</math> and <math>Y</math> (&eg;
	<lit>greene11_3.gdt</lit>) and we wish to estimate a nonlinear
	consumption function of the form
	<equation status="display"
	  tex="\[C = \alpha + \beta Y^{\gamma}\]"
	  ascii="C = alpha + beta * Y^gamma"
	  graphic="greene_Cfunc"/>
      </para>
      <para>
	The parameters alpha, beta and gamma must first be added to
	the dataset and given initial values.  Appropriate lines may
	be typed into the NLS specification window prior to the
	function specification.
      </para>
      <para>
	In the NLS window we type the following lines:
      </para>
      <code>
	C = alpha + beta * Y^gamma
	deriv alpha = 1
	deriv beta = Y^gamma
	deriv gamma = beta * Y^gamma * log(Y)
      </code>
      <para>
	The first line specifies the regression function, and the next
	three lines supply the derivatives of that function with respect
	to each of the parameters in turn. If the "deriv" lines are not
	given, a numerical approximation to the Jacobian is computed.
      </para>
      <para>
	If the parameters alpha, beta and gamma were not previously
	declared we could preface the above lines with something like the
	following:
      </para>
      <code>
	scalar alpha = 1
	scalar beta = 1
	scalar gamma = 1

      <para>
	Performs Nonlinear Least Squares (NLS) estimation using a
	modified version of the Levenberg&ndash;Marquardt algorithm.
	You must supply a function specification.  The parameters of
	this function must be declared and given starting values prior
	to estimation.  Optionally, you may specify the derivatives of
	the regression function with respect to each of the
	parameters.  If you do not supply derivatives you should
	instead give a list of the parameters to be estimated
	(separated by spaces or commas), preceded by the keyword
	<lit>params</lit>.  In the latter case a numerical
	approximation to the Jacobian is computed.
      </para>
      <para>
	It is easiest to show what is required by example.  The
	following is a complete script to estimate the nonlinear
	consumption function set out in William Greene's
	<book>Econometric Analysis</book> (Chapter 11 of the 4th
	edition, or Chapter 9 of the 5th).  The numbers to the left of
	the lines are for reference and are not part of the commands.
	Note that any option flags, such as <opt>vcv</opt> for
	printing the covariance matrix of the parameter estimates,
	should be appended to the final command, <lit>end nls</lit>.
      </para>
      <code>
	1   open greene11_3.gdt
	2   ols C 0 Y
	3   scalar a = $coeff(0)
	4   scalar b = $coeff(Y)
	5   scalar g = 1.0
	6   nls C = a + b * Y^g
	7    deriv a = 1
	8    deriv b = Y^g
	9    deriv g = b * Y^g * log(Y)
	10  end nls --vcv
      </code>
      <para>
	It is often convenient to initialize the parameters by
	reference to a related linear model; that is accomplished here
	on lines 2 to 5.  The parameters alpha, beta and gamma could
	be set to any initial values (not necessarily based on a model
	estimated with OLS), although convergence of the NLS procedure
	is not guaranteed for an arbitrary starting point.
      </para>
      <para>
	The actual NLS commands occupy lines 6 to 10. On line 6 the
	<cmd>nls</cmd> command is given: a dependent variable is
	specified, followed by an equals sign, followed by a function
	specification.  The syntax for the expression on the right is
	the same as that for the <cmd>genr</cmd> command.  The next
	three lines specify the derivatives of the regression function
	with respect to each of the parameters in turn.  Each line
	begins with the keyword <cmd>deriv</cmd>, gives the name of a
	parameter, an equals sign, and an expression whereby the
	derivative can be calculated. As an alternative to supplying
	numerical derivatives, you could substitute the following for
	lines 7 to 9:
      </para>
      <code>
	params a b g
      </code>
      <para>
	Line 10, <cmd>end nls</cmd>, completes the command and calls for
	estimation. Any options should be appended to this line.
      </para>
      <para>
	If you supply analytical derivatives, by default gretl runs a
	numerical check on their plausibility.  Occasionally this may
	produce false positives, instances where correct derivatives
	appear to be wrong and estimation is refused. To counter this,
	or to achieve a little extra speed, you can give the option
	<opt>no-gradient-check</opt>.  Obviously, you should do this
	only if you are confident that the gradient you have specified
	is right.
      </para>
      <subhead>Parameter names</subhead>
      <para>
	In estimating a nonlinear model it is often convenient to name
	the parameters tersely. In printing the results, however, it
	may be desirable to use more informative labels. This can be
	achieved via the additional keyword <lit>param_names</lit>
	within the command block. For a model with <math>k</math>
	parameters the argument following this keyword should be
	either a double-quoted string literal holding <math>k</math>
	space-separated names or the name of a string variable that
	holds <math>k</math> such names.
      </para>

	This command re-estimates the given model after omitting the specified

	the relevant box is available and is checked.  Besides the usual model

      <para>
	Sequential elimination works as follows: at each step the variable
	with the highest p-value is omitted, until all remaining variables
	have a p-value no greater than some cutoff.  The default cutoff is 10
	percent (two-sided); this can be adjusted via the spin button.  By

      <para>
	Opens a data file or database.  If a data file is already
	open, it is replaced by the newly opened one. To add data to
	the current dataset, see <cmdref targ="append"/> and (for
	greater flexibility) <cmdref targ="join"/>.
      </para>
      <para>
	If a full path is not given, the program will search some
	relevant paths to try to find the file, with <cmdref
	targ="workdir"/> as a first choice. If no filename suffix is
	given (as in the first example above), gretl assumes a native
	datafile with suffix <lit>.gdt</lit>.  Based on the name of
	the file and various heuristics, gretl will try to detect the
	format of the data file (native, plain text, CSV, MS Excel,
	Stata, SPSS, etc.).
      </para>
      <para>
	If the <opt>frompkg</opt> option is used, gretl will look for
	the specified data file in the subdirectory associated with
	the function package specified by <repl>pkgname</repl>.
      </para>
      <para>
	If the <repl>filename</repl> argument takes the form of a
	URI starting with <lit>http://</lit>, then gretl will attempt
	to download the indicated data file before opening it.
      </para>
      <para>
	By default, opening a new data file clears the current gretl
	session, which includes deletion of all named variables,
	including matrices, scalars and strings.  If you wish to keep
	your currently defined variables (other than series, which are
	necessarily cleared out), use the <opt>preserve</opt>
	option.
      </para>
      <para>
	The <lit>open</lit> command can also be used to open a database
	(gretl, RATS 4.0 or PcGive) for reading.  In that case it should be
	followed by the <cmdref targ="data"/> command to extract particular
	series from the database.  If the <lit>www</lit> option is given, the
	program will try to access a database of the given name on the gretl
	server &mdash; for instance the Federal Reserve interest rates
	database in the third example above.
      </para>
      <para>
	When opening a spreadsheet file (Gnumeric, Open Document or MS
	Excel), you may give up to three additional parameters
	following the filename.  First, you can select a particular
	worksheet within the file.  This is done either by giving its
	(1-based) number, using the syntax, &eg;,
	<opt>sheet=2</opt>, or, if you know the name of the sheet,
	by giving the name in double quotes, as in
	<opt>sheet="MacroData"</opt>. The default is to read the
	first worksheet. You can also specify a column and/or row
	offset into the worksheet via, &eg;,
      </para>
      <code>
	--coloffset=3 --rowoffset=2
      </code>
      <para>
	which would cause gretl to ignore the first 3 columns and the first 2
	rows.  The default is an offset of 0 in both dimensions, that is, to
	start reading at the top-left cell.
      </para>
      <para>
	With plain text files, gretl generally expects to find the data
	columns delimited in some standard manner.  But there is also a
	special facility for reading <quote>fixed format</quote> files, in
	which there are no delimiters but there is a known specification of
	the form, &eg;, <quote>variable <math>k</math> occupies 8 columns
	starting at column 24</quote>.  To read such files, you should append
	a string <opt>fixed-cols=</opt><repl>colspec</repl>, where
	<repl>colspec</repl> is composed of comma-separated integers.  These
	integers are interpreted as a set of pairs.  The first element of each
	pair denotes a starting column, measured in bytes from the beginning
	of the line with 1 indicating the first byte; and the second element
	indicates how many bytes should be read for the given field.  So, for
	example, if you say
      </para>
      <code>
	open fixed.txt --fixed-cols=1,6,20,3
      </code>
      <para>
	then for variable 1 gretl will read 6 bytes starting at column 1; and
	for variable 2, 3 bytes starting at column 20.  Lines that are blank,
	or that begin with <lit>#</lit>, are ignored, but otherwise the
	column-reading template is applied, and if anything other than a valid
	numerical value is found an error is flagged.  If the data are read
	successfully, the variables will be named <lit>v1</lit>,
	<lit>v2</lit>, etc.  It's up to the user to provide meaningful names
	and/or descriptions using the commands <cmdref targ="rename"/> and/or 
	<cmdref targ="setinfo"/>.

      <para>
	Diverts output to <repl>filename</repl>, until further notice.
	Use the flag <opt>append</opt> to append output to an existing
	file or <opt>write</opt> to start a new file (or overwrite an
	existing one).
      </para>
      <para>
	The <opt>close</opt> flag is used to close an
	output file that was previously opened as above.  Output will
	then revert to the default stream. Note that since only one
	file can be opened via <lit>outfile</lit> at any given time
	(but see below), no filename argument need (nor should) be
	supplied with this variant of the command.
      </para>
      <para>
	The output file will be written in the currently set <cmdref
	targ="workdir"/>, unless the <repl>filename</repl> string
	contains a full path specification.
      </para>
      <para>
	In the first example command above, the file
	<filename>regress.txt</filename> is opened for writing, and in
	the second it is closed.  This would make sense as a sequence
	only if some commands were issued before the <opt>close</opt>.
	For example if an estimation command intervened, its output
	would go to <filename>regress.txt</filename> rather than the
	screen.
      </para>
      <para>
	Three special variants on the above are available. If you give
	the keyword <lit>null</lit> in place of a real filename along
	with the <opt>write</opt> option, the effect is to suppress
	all printed output until redirection is ended. If either of
	the keywords <lit>stdout</lit> or <lit>stderr</lit> are given
	in place of a regular filename the effect is to redirect
	output to standard output or standard error output
	respectively.
      </para>
      <para>
	The <opt>quiet</opt> option is for use with <opt>write</opt>
	or <opt>append</opt>: its effect is to turn off the echoing
	of commands and the printing of auxiliary messages while
	output is redirected. It is equivalent to doing
      </para>
      <code>
	set echo off
	set messages off
      </code>
      <para>
	except that when redirection is ended the original values of
	the <lit>echo</lit> and <lit>messages</lit> variables are
	restored.
      </para>
      <para>
	In general only one file can be opened in this way at any
	given time, so calls to this command cannot be
	nested. However, use of this command is permitted inside
	user-written functions (provided the output file is also
	closed from inside the same function), so output can be
	temporarily diverted and then given back to an original output
	file (if <lit>outfile</lit> is currently in use by the
	caller). For example, the code
      </para>
      <code>
	function void f (string s)
	    outfile inner.txt --write
	    print s
	    outfile --close
	end function

	outfile outer.txt --write --quiet
	print "Outside"
	f("Inside")
	print "Outside again"
	outfile --close
      </code>
      <para>
	will produce a file called <quote>outer.txt</quote> containing
	the two lines
      </para>
      <code>
	Outside
	Outside again
      </code>
      <para>
	and a file called <quote>inner.txt</quote> containing the line

      <para>
	Computes and displays the spectrum of the specified series.
	By default the sample periodogram is given, but optionally a
	Bartlett lag window is used in estimating the spectrum (see,
	for example, Greene's <book>Econometric Analysis</book> for a
	discussion of this).  The default width of the Bartlett window
	is twice the square root of the sample size but this can be
	set manually using the <repl>bandwidth</repl> parameter, up to
	a maximum of half the sample size.
      </para>
      <para>
	If the <opt>log</opt> option is given the spectrum is
	represented on a logarithmic scale.
      </para>
      <para>
	The (mutually exclusive) options <opt>radians</opt> and
	<opt>degrees</opt> influence the appearance of the frequency
	axis when the periodogram is graphed. By default the frequency
	is scaled by the number of periods in the sample, but these
	options cause the axis to be labeled from 0 to &pi; radians
	or from 0 to 180&deg;, respectively.
      </para>
      <para>
	By default, if the program is not in batch mode a plot of the
	periodogram is shown.  This can be adjusted via the
	<opt>plot</opt> option. The acceptable parameters to this
	option are <lit>none</lit> (to suppress the plot);
	<lit>display</lit> (to display a plot even when in batch
	mode); or a file name. The effect of providing a file name is
	as described for the <opt>output</opt> option of the <cmdref
	targ="gnuplot"/> command.

      <para>
	The <lit>plot</lit> block provides an alternative to the
	<cmdref targ="gnuplot"/> command which may be more convenient
	when you are producing an elaborate plot (with several options
	and/or gnuplot commands to be inserted into the plot file).
      </para>
      <para>
	A <lit>plot</lit> block starts with the command-word
	<lit>plot</lit> followed by the required argument,
	<repl>data</repl>, which specifies the data to be plotted:
	this should be the name of a list, a matrix, or a single
	series.
      </para>
      <para>
	If a list or matrix is given, the last element (list) or
	column (matrix) is assumed to be the <math>x</math>-axis
	variable and the other(s) the <math>y</math>-axis variable(s),
	unless the <opt>time-series</opt> option is given in which
	case all the specified data go on the <math>y</math> axis.
      </para>
      <para>
	The option of supplying a single series name is restricted to
	time-series data, in which case it is assumed that a
	time-series plot is wanted; otherwise an error is flagged.
      </para>
      <para>
	The starting line may be prefixed with
	the <quote><repl>savename</repl> <lit>&lt;-</lit></quote>
	apparatus to save a plot as an icon in the GUI program.
	The block ends with <lit>end plot</lit>.
      </para>
      <para>
	Inside the block you have zero or more lines of these types,
	identified by an initial keyword:
      </para>
      <ilist>
	<li>
	  <para>
	    <lit>option</lit>: specify a single option.
	  </para>
	</li>
	<li>
	  <para>
	  <lit>options</lit>: specify multiple options on a single
	  line, separated by spaces.
	  </para>
	</li>

	    literally.
	  </para>
	</li>
	<li>
	  <para>
	    <lit>printf</lit>: a printf statement whose result will be
	    passed to gnuplot literally.
	  </para>
	</li>
      </ilist>
      <para>
	Note that when you specify an option using the
	<lit>option</lit> or <lit>options</lit> keywords, it is not
	necessary to supply the customary double-dash before the
	option specifier. For details on the effects of the various
	options please see <cmdref targ="gnuplot"/> (but see
	below for some specifics on using the <opt>band</opt>
	option in the <lit>plot</lit> context).
      </para>
      <para>
	The intended use of the <lit>plot</lit> block is best
	illustrated by example:
      </para>
      <code>
	string title = "My title"
	string xname = "My x-variable"
	plot plotmat
	    options with-lines fit=none
	    literal set linetype 3 lc rgb "#0000ff"
	    literal set nokey
	    printf "set title \"%s\"", title
	    printf "set xlabel \"%s\"", xname
	end plot --output=display
      </code>
      <para>
	This example assumes that <lit>plotmat</lit> is the name of a
	matrix with at least 2 columns (or a list with at least two
	members).  Note that it is considered good practice to place
	the <opt>output</opt> option (only) on the last line of the
	block.
      </para>
      <subhead>Plotting a band with matrix data</subhead>
      <para>
	The <opt>band</opt> and <opt>band-style</opt> options mostly
	work as described in the help for <lit>gnuplot</lit>,
	with the following exception: when the data to be plotted are
	given in the form of a matrix, the first parameter to
	<opt>band</opt> must be given as the name of a matrix with two
	columns (holding, respectively, the center and the width of
	the band). This parameter takes the place of the two values
	(series names or ID numbers, or matrix columns) required by
	the <lit>gnuplot</lit> version of this option. An illustration
	follows:
      </para>
      <code>
	scalar n = 100
	matrix x = seq(1,n)'
	matrix y = x + filter(mnormal(n,1), 1, {1.8, -0.9})
	matrix B = y ~ muniform(n,1)
	plot y
	    options time-series with-lines
	    options band=B,10 band-style=fill
	end plot --output=display

    label="Polynomial trend fitting">

    <description>
      <para>
	In fitting a polynomial trend to a time series it may be
	desirable to give extra weight to the observations at the
	start and end of the sample. (Points in the middle of the
	sample range have neighbours on both sides that are likely to
	be pulling the fit in the same general direction.)
      </para>
      <para>
	The weighting schemes offered here (quadratic, cosine-bell and
	steps) can be used to this effect. If you select one of these
	schemes two additional settings must be chosen: first, what
	maximum weight should be used (the minimum, baseline weight is
	1.0)?  Second, what central fraction of the sample should be
	given a uniform (minimal) weighting?
      </para>
      <para>
	Suppose, for example, you select a maximum weight of 3.0 and a
	central fraction of 0.4. This means that the middle 40 percent
	of the data get a weight of 1.0. If the <quote>steps</quote>
	shape is selected the first and last 30 percent of the
	observations get a weight of 3.0; otherwise, for the first 30
	percent of observations the weights decline gradually from 3.0
	to 1.0; and for the last 30 percent the weights increase from
	1.0 to 3.0.

      <para>
	Estimates a poisson regression.  The dependent variable is taken to
	represent the occurrence of events of some sort, and must take on only
	non-negative integer values.
      </para>
      <para>
	If a discrete random variable <math>Y</math> follows
	the Poisson distribution, then
        <equation status="display" 
          tex="\[\mathrm{Pr}(Y = y) = \frac{e^{-v} v^y}{y!}\]"
          ascii="Pr(Y = y) = exp(-v) * v^y / y!"
          graphic="poisson1"/>
	for <math>y</math> = 0, 1,
      2,&hellip;.  The mean and variance of the distribution are both
      equal to <math>v</math>.  In the Poisson regression model,
      the parameter <math>v</math> is represented as a function
      of one or more independent variables.  The most common version
      (and the only one supported by gretl) has
        <equation status="display" 
          tex="\[v = \mathrm{exp}(\beta_0+\beta_1 x_1+\beta_2 x_2 + \cdots)\]"
          ascii="v = exp(b0 + b1*x1 + b2*x2 + ...)"
          graphic="poisson2"/>
	or in other words the log of
      <math>v</math> is a linear function of the independent
      variables.
      </para>
      <para>
	Optionally, you may add an <quote>offset</quote> variable to the
	specification.  This is a scale variable, the log of which is added to
	the linear regression function (implicitly, with a coefficient of
	1.0).  This makes sense if you expect the number of occurrences of the
	event in question to be proportional, other things equal, to some
	known factor.  For example, the number of traffic accidents might be
	supposed to be proportional to traffic volume, other things equal, and
	in that case traffic volume could be specified as an
	<quote>offset</quote> in a Poisson model of the accident rate. The
	offset variable must be strictly positive.  
      </para>
      <para>
	By default, standard errors are computed using the negative
	inverse of the Hessian.  If the <opt>robust</opt> flag is given,
	then QML or Huber&ndash;White standard errors are calculated
	instead. In this case the estimated covariance matrix is a
	<quote>sandwich</quote> of the inverse of the estimated Hessian
	and the outer product of the gradient.

      <para>
	Prints scalar values, series, matrices, or strings under the control

	statement in the C programming language).  Recognized numeric formats
	are <lit>%e</lit>, <lit>%E</lit>, <lit>%f</lit>, <lit>%g</lit>,
	<lit>%G</lit> and <lit>%d</lit>, in each case with the various
	modifiers available in C.  Examples: the format <lit>%.10g</lit>
	prints a value to 10 significant figures; <lit>%12.6f</lit> prints a
	value to 6 decimal places, with a width of 12 characters.  The format
	<lit>%s</lit> should be used for strings.
      </para>
      <para>
	The format string itself must be enclosed in double quotes.  The
	values to be printed must follow the format string, separated by
	commas.  These values should take the form of either (a) the names of
	variables, (b) expressions that are valid for the <cmd>genr</cmd>
	command, or (c) the special functions <lit>varname()</lit> or
	<lit>date()</lit>.  The following example prints the values of two
	variables plus that of a calculated expression:
      </para>
      <code>
	ols 1 0 2 3
	scalar b = $coeff[2]
	scalar se_b = $stderr[2]
	printf "b = %.8g, standard error %.8g, t = %.4f\n", 
          b, se_b, b/se_b
      </code>
      <para>
	The next lines illustrate the use of the varname and date functions,
	which respectively print the name of a variable, given its ID number,
	and a date string, given a 1-based observation number.
      </para>
      <code>
	printf "The name of variable %d is %s\n", i, varname(i)
	printf "The date of observation %d is %s\n", j, date(j)
      </code>
      <para>
	If a matrix argument is given in association with a numeric
	format, the entire matrix is printed using the specified
	format for each element.  The same applies to series, except
	that the range of values printed is governed by the current
	sample setting.
      </para>
      <para>
	The maximum length of a format string is 127 characters.  The
	escape sequences <lit>\n</lit> (newline), <lit>\t</lit> (tab),
	<lit>\v</lit> (vertical tab) and <lit>\\</lit> (literal
	backslash) are recognized.  To print a literal percent sign,
	use <lit>%%</lit>.
      </para>
      <para>
	As in C, numerical values that form part of the format (width and or
	precision) may be given directly as numbers, as in <lit>%10.4f</lit>,
	or they may be given as variables.  In the latter case, one puts
	asterisks into the format string and supplies corresponding arguments
	in order.  For example,
      </para>
      <code>
	scalar width = 12
	scalar precision = 6
	printf "x = %*.*f\n", width, precision, x

	If the dependent variable is a binary variable (all values are 0
	or 1) maximum likelihood estimates of the coefficients on
	<repl>indepvars</repl> are obtained via the Newton&ndash;Raphson
	method. As the model is nonlinear the slopes depend on the
	values of the independent variables.  By default the slopes with
	respect to each of the independent variables are calculated (at
	the means of those variables) and these slopes replace the usual
	p-values in the regression output.  This behavior can be
	suppressed my giving the <opt>p-values</opt> option. The
	chi-square statistic tests the null hypothesis that all
	coefficients are zero apart from the constant.

	Imposes a set of (usually linear) restrictions on either (a)

	previously defined and named. In all cases the set of
	restrictions should be started with the keyword
	<quote>restrict</quote> and terminated with <quote>end
	restrict</quote>.
      </para>
      <para>
	In the single equation case the restrictions are always
	implicitly to be applied to the last model, and they are
	evaluated as soon as the <lit>restrict</lit> block is closed.
      </para>
      <para>
	In the case of a system of equations (defined via the <cmdref
	targ="system"/> command), the initial <quote>restrict</quote>
	may be followed by the name of a previously defined system of
	equations. If this is omitted and the last model was a system
	then the restrictions are applied to the last model. By
	default the restrictions are evaluated when the system is next
	estimated, using the <cmdref targ="estimate"/> command. But if
	the <opt>wald</opt> option is given the restriction is
	tested right away, via a Wald chi-square test on the
	covariance matrix. Note that this option will produce an error
	if a system has been defined but not yet estimated.
      </para>
      <para>
	Depending on the context, the restrictions to be tested may be
	expressed in various ways.  The simplest form is as follows: each
	restriction is given as an equation, with a linear combination of
	parameters on the left and a scalar value to the right of the equals
	sign (either a numerical constant or the name of a scalar variable).
      </para>
      <para>
	In the single-equation case, parameters may be referenced in the form
	<lit>b[</lit><repl>i</repl><lit>]</lit>, where <repl>i</repl>
	represents the position in the list of regressors (starting at 1), or
	<lit>b[</lit><repl>varname</repl><lit>]</lit>, where
	<repl>varname</repl> is the name of the regressor in question. In the
	system case, parameters are referenced using <lit>b</lit> plus two
	numbers in square brackets. The leading number represents the position
	of the equation within the system and the second number indicates
	position in the list of regressors.  For example <lit>b[2,1]</lit>
	denotes the first parameter in the second equation, and
	<lit>b[3,2]</lit> the second parameter in the third equation.
	The <lit>b</lit> terms in the equation representing a restriction may
	be prefixed with a numeric multiplier, for example
	<lit>3.5*b[4]</lit>.
      </para>
      <para>
	Here is an example of a set of restrictions for a previously estimated
	model:
      </para>
      <code>
	restrict
	 b[1] = 0
	 b[2] - b[3] = 0
	 b[4] + 2*b[5] = 1
	end restrict
      </code>
      <para>
	And here is an example of a set of restrictions to be applied to a
	named system.  (If the name of the system does not contain spaces, the
	surrounding quotes are not required.)
      </para>
      <code>
	restrict "System 1"
	 b[1,1] = 0
	 b[1,2] - b[2,2] = 0
	 b[3,4] + 2*b[3,5] = 1
	end restrict
      </code>
      <para>
	In the single-equation case the restrictions are by default evaluated
	via a Wald test, using the covariance matrix of the model in question.
	If the original model was estimated via OLS then the restricted
	coefficient estimates are printed; to suppress this, append the
	<opt>quiet</opt> option flag to the initial <lit>restrict</lit>
	command.  As an alternative to the Wald test, for models estimated via
	OLS or WLS only, you can give the <opt>bootstrap</opt> option to
	perform a bootstrapped test of the restriction.
      </para>
      <para>
	In the system case, the test statistic depends on the estimator
	chosen: a Likelihood Ratio test if the system is estimated using a
	Maximum Likelihood method, or an asymptotic <math>F</math>-test
	otherwise.
      </para>
      <para>
	There are two alternatives to the method of expressing restrictions
	discussed above.  First, a set of <math>g</math> linear restrictions
	on a <math>k</math>-vector of parameters, &bgr;, may be written
	compactly as <math>R</math>&bgr; &minus; <math>q</math> = 0, where
	<math>R</math> is an <by r="g" c="k"/> matrix and <math>q</math> is a
	<math>g</math>-vector.  You can specify a restriction by giving the
	names of pre-defined, conformable matrices to be used as
	<math>R</math> and <math>q</math>, as in
      </para>
      <code>
	restrict 
	  R = Rmat
	  q = qvec
	end restrict
      </code>
      <para>
	Secondly, if you wish to test a nonlinear restriction (this is
	currently available for single-equation models only) you should give
	the restriction as the name of a function, preceded by
	<quote><lit>rfunc = </lit></quote>, as in
      </para>
      <code>
	restrict
	  rfunc = myfunction
	end restrict
      </code>
      <para>
	The constraint function should take a single <lit>const matrix</lit>
	argument; this will be automatically filled out with the parameter
	vector.  And it should return a vector which is zero under the null
	hypothesis, non-zero otherwise.  The length of the vector is the
	number of restrictions. This function is used as a
	<quote>callback</quote> by gretl's numerical Jacobian routine, which
	calculates a Wald test statistic via the delta method.
      </para>
      <para>
	Here is a simple example of a function suitable for testing one
	nonlinear restriction, namely that two pairs of parameter values have
	a common ratio. 
      </para>
      <code>
	function matrix restr (const matrix b)
	  matrix v = b[1]/b[2] - b[4]/b[5]
	  return v
	end function
      </code>
      <para>
	On successful completion of the <lit>restrict</lit> command
	the accessors <fncref targ="$test"/> and <fncref
	targ="$pvalue"/> give the test statistic and its p-value.
      </para>
      <para>
	When testing restrictions on a single-equation model estimated
	via OLS, or on a VECM, the <opt>full</opt> option can be
	used to set the restricted estimates as the <quote>last
	model</quote> for the purposes of further testing or the use
	of accessors such as <lit>$coeff</lit> and <lit>$vcv</lit>.
	Note that some special considerations apply in the case of
	testing restrictions on Vector Error Correction Models. Please
	see <guideref targ="chap:vecm"/> for details.

      <para>
	Range&ndash;mean plot: this command creates a simple graph to
	help in deciding whether a time series, <math>y</math>(t), has
	constant variance or not.  We take the full sample t=1,...,T
	and divide it into small subsamples of arbitrary size
	<math>k</math>. The first subsample is formed by
	<math>y</math>(1),...,<math>y</math>(k), the second is
	<math>y</math>(k+1), ..., <math>y</math>(2k), and so on.  For
	each subsample we calculate the sample mean and range (=
	maximum minus minimum), and we construct a graph with the
	means on the horizontal axis and the ranges on the
	vertical. So each subsample is represented by a point in this
	plane.  If the variance of the series is constant we would
	expect the subsample range to be independent of the subsample
	mean; if we see the points approximate an upward-sloping line
	this suggests the variance of the series is increasing in its
	mean; and if the points approximate a downward sloping line
	this suggests the variance is decreasing in the mean.
      </para>
      <para>
	Besides the graph, gretl displays the means and ranges for
	each subsample, along with the slope coefficient for an OLS
	regression of the range on the mean and the p-value for the
	null hypothesis that this slope is zero.  If the slope
	coefficient is significant at the 10 percent significance
	level then the fitted line from the regression of range on
	mean is shown on the graph.  The <math>t</math>-statistic for
	the null, and the corresponding p-value, are recorded and may
	be retrieved using the accessors <fncref targ="$test"/> and
	<fncref targ="$pvalue"/> respectively.
      </para>
      <para context="cli">
	If the <opt>trim</opt> option is given, the minimum and maximum

    <description>
      <para>
	The most common use of this command is the first variant shown above,
	where it is used to set the value of a selected program parameter.
	This is discussed in detail below.  The other uses are: with
	<opt>to-file</opt>, to write a script file containing all the
	current parameter settings; with <opt>from-file</opt> to read a
	script file containing parameter settings and apply them to the
	current session; with <lit>stopwatch</lit> to zero the gretl
	<quote>stopwatch</quote> which can be used to measure CPU time (see
	the entry for the <lit>$stopwatch</lit> accessor in the gretl function
	reference); or, if the word <lit>set</lit> is given alone, to print
	the current settings.
      </para>
      <para>
	Values set via this comand remain in force for the duration of
	the gretl session unless they are changed by a further call to
	<cmd>set</cmd>. The parameters that can be set in this way are
	enumerated below. Note that the settings of
	<lit>hc_version</lit>, <lit>hac_lag</lit> and
	<lit>hac_kernel</lit> are used when the <opt>robust</opt>
	option is given to an estimation command.
      </para>
      <para>
	The available settings are grouped under the following categories:
	program interaction and behavior, numerical methods, random number
	generation, robust estimation, filtering, time series 
	estimation, and interaction with GNU R.
      </para>

      <subhead>Program interaction and behavior</subhead>

      <para>
	These settings are used for controlling various aspects of the way
	gretl interacts with the user.
      </para>
      <ilist>
	<li>
	  <para><lit>workdir</lit>: <repl>path</repl>.  Sets the
	  default directory for writing and reading files, whenever
	  full paths are not specified.
	  </para>
	</li>
	<li>
	  <para><lit>use_cwd</lit>: <lit>on</lit> or <lit>off</lit>
	  (the default). Governs the setting of <lit>workdir</lit> at
	  start-up: if it's <lit>on</lit>, the working directory is
	  inherited from the shell, otherwise it is set to whatever
	  was selected in the previous gretl session.
	  </para>
	</li>	
	<li>
	  <para><lit>csv_delim</lit>: either <lit>comma</lit> (the default),
	    <lit>space</lit>, <lit>tab</lit> or <lit>semicolon</lit>.  Sets
	    the column delimiter used when saving data to file in CSV format.
	  </para>
	</li>
	<li>
	  <para><lit>csv_write_na</lit>: the string used to represent
	  missing values when writing data to file in CSV format.
	  Maximum 7 characters; the default is <lit>NA</lit>.
	  </para>
	</li>
	<li>
	  <para><lit>csv_read_na</lit>: the string taken to represent
	  missing values (NAs) when reading data in CSV
	  format. Maximum 7 characters. The default depends on whether
	  a data column is found to contain numerical data (mostly) or
	  string values. For numerical data the following are taken as
	  indicating NAs: an empty cell, or any of the strings
	  <lit>NA</lit>, <lit>N.A.</lit>, <lit>na</lit>,
	  <lit>n.a.</lit>, <lit>N/A</lit>, <lit>#N/A</lit>,
	  <lit>NaN</lit>, <lit>.NaN</lit>, <lit>.</lit>,
	  <lit>..</lit>, <lit>-999</lit>, and <lit>-9999</lit>.  For
	  string-valued data only a blank cell, or a cell containing
	  an empty string, is counted as NA. These defaults can be
	  reimposed by giving <lit>default</lit> as the value for
	  <lit>csv_read_na</lit>. To specify that only empty cells
	  are read as NAs, give a value of <lit>""</lit>. Note that
	  empty cells are always read as NAs regardless of the setting
	  of this variable.
	  </para>
	</li>
	<li>
	  <para><lit>csv_digits</lit>: a positive integer specifying
	  the number of significant digits to use when writing data in
	  CSV format. By default up to 15 digits are used depending on
	  the precision of the original data. Note that CSV output
	  employs the C library's <lit>fprintf</lit> function with
	  <quote><lit>%g</lit></quote> conversion, which means that
	  trailing zeros are dropped.
	  </para>
	</li>
	<li>
	  <para><lit>mwrite_g</lit>: <lit>on</lit> or <lit>off</lit>
	  (the default). When writing a matrix to file as text, gretl
	  by default uses scientific notation with 18-digit precision,
	  hence ensuring that the stored values are a faithful
	  representation of the numbers in memory. When writing
	  primary data with no more than 6 digits of precision it may
	  be preferable to use <lit>%g</lit> format for a more compact
	  and human-readable file; you can make this switch via
	  <lit>set mwrite_g on</lit>.
	  </para>
	</li>
	<li>
	  <para><lit>echo</lit>: <lit>off</lit> or <lit>on</lit> (the
	  default). Suppress or resume the echoing of commands in gretl's
	  output.
	  </para>
	</li>
	<li>
	  <para><lit>force_decpoint</lit>: <lit>on</lit> or <lit>off</lit>
	    (the default).  Force gretl to use the decimal point
	    character, in a locale where another character (most likely
	    the comma) is the standard decimal separator.
	  </para>
	</li>
	<li>	  
	  <para><lit>loop_maxiter</lit>: one non-negative integer
	  value (default 100000).  Sets the maximum number of
	  iterations that a <lit>while</lit> loop is allowed before
	  halting (see <cmdref targ="loop"/>). Note that this setting
	  only affects the <lit>while</lit> variant; its purpose is to
	  guard against inadvertently infinite loops. Setting this
	  value to 0 has the effect of disabling the limit; use with
	  caution.
	  </para>
	</li>
	<li>
	  <para><lit>max_verbose</lit>: <lit>on</lit> or
	  <lit>off</lit> (the default). Toggles verbose output for the
	  <lit>BFGSmax</lit> and <lit>NRmax</lit> functions (see the
	  User's Guide for details).
	</para>
	</li>
	<li>
	  <para><lit>messages</lit>: <lit>off</lit> or <lit>on</lit> (the
	  default). Suppress or resume the printing of non-error messages
	  associated with various commands, for example when a new variable is
	  generated or when the sample range is changed.
         </para>
	</li>
	<li>
	  <para><lit>warnings</lit>: <lit>off</lit> or <lit>on</lit> (the
	  default). Suppress or resume the printing of warning messages
	  issued when arithmetical operations produce non-finite values. 
         </para>
	</li>
	<li>
	  <para><lit>debug</lit>: <lit>1</lit>, <lit>2</lit> or <lit>0</lit>
	    (the default).  This is for use with user-defined functions.
	    Setting <lit>debug</lit> to 1 is equivalent to turning
	    <lit>messages</lit> on within all such functions; setting this
	    variable to <lit>2</lit> has the additional effect of turning on
	    <lit>max_verbose</lit> within all functions.
	  </para>
	</li>
	<li>
	  <para><lit>shell_ok</lit>: <lit>on</lit> or <lit>off</lit>
	  (the default). Enable launching external programs from
	  gretl via the system shell. This is disabled by default for
	  security reasons, and can only be enabled via the graphical
	  user interface (Tools/Preferences/General). However, once
	  set to on, this setting will remain active for future
	  sessions until explicitly disabled.
	  </para>
	</li>
	<li>
	  <para><lit>shelldir</lit>: <repl>path</repl>.  Sets the current
	  working directory for shell commands issued from within gretl.
	  </para>
	</li>
	<li>
	  <para><lit>bfgs_verbskip</lit>: one integer. This setting
	  affects the behavior of the <opt>verbose</opt> option to
	  those commands that use BFGS as an optimization algorithm and
	  is used to compact output. if <lit>bfgs_verbskip</lit> is
	  set to, say, 3, then the <opt>verbose</opt> switch will
	  only print iterations 3, 6, 9 and so on.
	  </para>
	</li>
	<li>
	  <para><lit>skip_missing</lit>: <lit>on</lit> (the default)
	  or <lit>off</lit>. Controls gretl's behavior when
	  contructing a matrix from data series: the default is to
	  skip data rows that contain one or more missing values but
	  if <lit>skip_missing</lit> is set <lit>off</lit> missing
	  values are converted to NaNs.
	  </para>
	</li>
	<li>
	  <para><lit>matrix_mask</lit>: the name of a series, or the
	  keyword <lit>null</lit>. Offers greater control than 
	  <lit>skip_missing</lit> when constructing matrices from
	  series: the data rows selected for matrices are those
	  with non-zero (and non-missing) values in the specified
	  series. The selected mask remains in force until it is 
	  replaced, or removed via the <lit>null</lit> keyword.
	  </para>
	</li>
	<li>
	  <para><lit>huge</lit>: a large positive number (by default,
	  1.0E100). This setting controls the value returned by the
	  accessor <fncref targ="$huge"/>.
	  </para>
	</li>
      </ilist>

      <subhead>Numerical methods</subhead>

      <para>
	These settings are used for controlling the numerical
	algorithms that gretl uses for estimation.
      </para>
      <ilist>
	<li>	
	  <para><lit>optimizer</lit>: either <lit>auto</lit> (the
	  default), <lit>BFGS</lit> or <lit>newton</lit>. Sets the
	  optimization algorithm used for various ML estimators, in
	  cases where both BFGS and Newton&ndash;Raphson are
	  applicable. The default is to use Newton&ndash;Raphson
	  where an analytical Hessian is available, otherwise BFGS.
	  </para>
	</li>
	<li>	
	  <para><lit>bhhh_maxiter</lit>: one integer, the maximum number of
	    iterations for gretl's internal BHHH routine, which is used in
	    the <cmd>arma</cmd> command for conditional ML estimation. If
	    convergence is not achieved after <lit>bhhh_maxiter</lit>, the
	    program returns an error. The default is set at 500.
	  </para>
	</li>	  
	<li>	  
	  <para><lit>bhhh_toler</lit>: one floating point value, or the
	    string <lit>default</lit>.  This is used in gretl's internal
	    BHHH routine to check if convergence has occurred. The
	    algorithm stops iterating as soon as the increment in the
	    log-likelihood between iterations is smaller than
	    <lit>bhhh_toler</lit>.  The default value is 1.0E&minus;06;
	    this value may be re-established by typing <lit>default</lit>
	    in place of a numeric value.
	  </para>
	</li>
	<li>
	  <para><lit>bfgs_maxiter</lit>: one integer, the maximum number of
	    iterations for gretl's BFGS routine, which is used for
	    <cmd>mle</cmd>, <cmd>gmm</cmd> and several specific
	    estimators. If convergence is not achieved in the specified
	    number of iterations, the program returns an error. The
	    default value depends on the context, but is typically
	    of the order of 500.
	  </para>
	</li>	  
	<li>	  
	  <para><lit>bfgs_toler</lit>: one floating point value, or the
	    string <lit>default</lit>.  This is used in gretl's BFGS
	    routine to check if convergence has occurred. The algorithm
	    stops as soon as the relative improvement in the objective
	    function between iterations is smaller than
	    <lit>bfgs_toler</lit>.  The default value is the machine
	    precision to the power 3/4; this value may be re-established
	    by typing <lit>default</lit> in place of a numeric value.
	  </para>
	</li>
	<li>	  
	  <para><lit>bfgs_maxgrad</lit>: one floating point value. This is
	    used in gretl's BFGS routine to check if the norm of the gradient
	    is reasonably close to zero when the <lit>bfgs_toler</lit>
	    criterion is met.  A warning is printed if the norm of the
	    gradient exceeds 1; an error is flagged if the norm exceeds
	    <lit>bfgs_maxgrad</lit>. At present the default is the 
	    permissive value of 5.0.
	  </para>
	</li>
	<li>
	  <para><lit>bfgs_richardson</lit>: <lit>on</lit> or
	  <lit>off</lit> (the default). Use Richardson extrapolation
	  when computing numerical derivatives in the context of BFGS
	  maximization.
	  </para>
	</li>
	<li>	  
	  <para><lit>initvals</lit>: either <lit>auto</lit> (the
	  default) or the name of a pre-specified matrix. Allows
	  manual setting of the initial parameter estimates for
	  numerical optimization problems (such as ARMA
	  estimation). For details see <guideref
	  targ="chap:timeseries"/>.
	  </para>
	</li>
	<li>
	  <para><lit>lbfgs</lit>: <lit>on</lit> or <lit>off</lit> (the
	    default). Use the limited-memory version of BFGS (L-BFGS-B)
	    instead of the ordinary algorithm. This may be advantageous when
	    the function to be maximized is not globally concave.
	  </para>
	</li>
	<li>
	  <para><lit>lbfgs_mem</lit>: an integer value in the range 3 to 20
	    (with a default value of 8).  This determines the number of
	    corrections used in the limited memory matrix when L-BFGS-B
	    is employed.  
	  </para>
	</li>
	<li>
	<para>
	  <lit>nls_toler</lit>: a floating-point value (the default is the
	  machine precision to the power 3/4).  Sets the tolerance used in
	  judging whether or not convergence has occurred in nonlinear least
	  squares estimation using the <cmdref targ="nls"/> command.
	</para>
	</li>
	<li>
	  <para>
	    <lit>svd</lit>: <lit>on</lit> or <lit>off</lit> (the default). Use
	    SVD rather than Cholesky or QR decomposition in least squares
	    calculations.  This option applies to the <lit>mols</lit> function
	    as well as various internal calculations, but not to the regular
	    <cmdref targ="ols"/> command.
	  </para>
	</li>
	<li>
	  <para>
	    <lit>force_qr</lit>: <lit>on</lit> or <lit>off</lit> (the
	    default). This applies to the <cmdref targ="ols"/>
	    command. By default this command computes OLS estimates
	    using Cholesky decomposition (the fastest method), with a
	    fallback to QR if the data seem too ill-conditioned. You
	    can use <lit>force_qr</lit> to skip the Cholesky step; in
	    <quote>doubtful</quote> cases this may ensure greater
	    accuracy.
	  </para>
	</li>	
	<li>
	  <para><lit>fcp</lit>: <lit>on</lit> or <lit>off</lit> (the
	    default). Use the algorithm of Fiorentini, Calzolari and
	    Panattoni rather than native gretl code when computing
	    GARCH estimates.</para>
	</li>
	<li>
	  <para><lit>gmm_maxiter</lit>: one integer, the maximum number of
	    iterations for gretl's <cmdref targ="gmm"/> command when in iterated
	    mode (as opposed to one- or two-step).  The default value is
	    250.
	  </para>
	</li>
	<li>
	  <para><lit>nadarwat_trim</lit>: one integer, the trim
	  parameter used in the  <fncref targ="nadarwat"/> function.
	  </para>
	</li>
	<li>
	  <para><lit>fdjac_quality</lit>: one integer between 0 and 2,
	  the algorithm used by the <fncref targ="fdjac"/> function.

	</li>
      </ilist>

      <subhead>Random number generation</subhead>

      <ilist>
	<li>
	  <para><lit>seed</lit>: an unsigned integer.  Sets the seed for
	    the pseudo-random number generator.  By default this is set from the
	    system time; if you want to generate repeatable sequences of random
	    numbers you must set the seed manually.
	  </para>
	</li>
	<li>
	  <para><lit>normal_rand</lit>: <lit>ziggurat</lit> (the default) or
	    <lit>box-muller</lit>.  Sets the method for generating random
	    normal samples based on uniform input.

	</li>
      </ilist>

      <subhead>Robust estimation</subhead>

      <ilist>
	<li>
	  <para><lit>bootrep</lit>: an integer. Sets the number of

	  the <opt>bootstrap</opt> option.</para>
	</li>
	<li>
	  <para><lit>garch_vcv</lit>: <lit>unset</lit>,
	    <lit>hessian</lit>, <lit>im</lit> (information matrix) ,
	    <lit>op</lit> (outer product matrix), <lit>qml</lit> (QML
	    estimator), <lit>bw</lit> (Bollerslev&ndash;Wooldridge). Specifies
	    the variant that will be used for estimating the coefficient
	    covariance matrix, for GARCH models.  If <lit>unset</lit> is given
	    (the default) then the Hessian is used unless the
	    <quote>robust</quote> option is given for the garch command, in
	    which case QML is used.
	  </para>
	</li>
	<li>
	  <para><lit>arma_vcv</lit>: <lit>hessian</lit> (the default) or
	    <lit>op</lit> (outer product matrix). Specifies the variant
	    to be used when computing the covariance matrix for ARIMA
	    models.
	  </para>
	</li>
	<li>
	  <para><lit>force_hc</lit>: <lit>off</lit> (the default) or
	  <lit>on</lit>.  By default, with time-series data and when
	  the <opt>robust</opt> option is given with <lit>ols</lit>,
	  the HAC estimator is used.  If you set <lit>force_hc</lit>
	  to <quote>on</quote>, this forces calculation of the regular
	  Heteroskedasticity Consistent Covariance Matrix (HCCM),
	  which does not take autocorrelation into account. Note that
	  VARs are treated as a special case: when the <opt>robust</opt>
	  option is given the default method is regular HCCM, but the
	  <opt>robust-hac</opt> flag can be used to force the use of a
	  HAC estimator.
	  </para>
	</li>
	<li>
	  <para><lit>robust_z</lit>: <lit>off</lit> (the default) or
	  <lit>on</lit>. This controls the distribution used when
	  calculating p-values based on robust standard errors in
	  the context of least-squares estimators. By default gretl
	  uses the Student <math>t</math> distribution but if
	  <lit>robust_z</lit> is turned on the normal distribution
	  is used.
	  </para>
	</li>
	<li>
	  <para><lit>hac_lag</lit>: <lit>nw1</lit> (the default),
	    <lit>nw2</lit>, <lit>nw3</lit> or an integer.  Sets the
	    maximum lag value or bandwidth, <math>p</math>, used when
	    calculating HAC (Heteroskedasticity and Autocorrelation
	    Consistent) standard errors using the Newey-West approach, for
	    time series data.  <lit>nw1</lit> and <lit>nw2</lit> represent
	    two variant automatic calculations based on the sample size,
	    <math>T</math>: for nw1, 
	    <equation status="inline"
	      tex="$p = 0.75 \times T^{1/3}$" 
	      ascii="p = 0.75 * T^(1/3)"
	      graphic="nw1"/>, and for nw2, 
	    <equation status="inline"
	      tex="$p = 4 \times (T/100)^{2/9}$" 
	      ascii="p = 4 * (T/100)^(2/9)" 
	      graphic="nw2"/>. <lit>nw3</lit> calls for data-based
	    bandwidth selection.  See also <lit>qs_bandwidth</lit> and
	    <lit>hac_prewhiten</lit> below.
	  </para>
	</li>
	<li>
	  <para><lit>hac_kernel</lit>: <lit>bartlett</lit> (the default),
	    <lit>parzen</lit>, or <lit>qs</lit> (Quadratic Spectral). Sets
	    the kernel, or pattern of weights, used when calculating HAC
	    standard errors.
	  </para>
	</li>
	<li>
	  <para><lit>hac_prewhiten</lit>: <lit>on</lit> or <lit>off</lit>
	    (the default). Use Andrews-Monahan prewhitening and
	    re-coloring when computing HAC standard errors.  This also
	    implies use of data-based bandwidth selection.
	  </para>
	</li>
	<li>
	  <para>
	    <lit>hc_version</lit>: 0 (the default), 1, 2, 3 or 3a. Sets the
	    variant used when calculating Heteroskedasticity Consistent
	    standard errors with cross-sectional data.  The first four options
	    correspond to the HC0, HC1, HC2 and HC3 discussed by
	    Davidson and MacKinnon in <book>Econometric Theory and
	      Methods</book>, chapter 5.  HC0 produces what are usually called
	    <quote>White's standard errors</quote>.  Variant 3a is
	    the MacKinnon&ndash;White <quote>jackknife</quote> procedure.
	  </para>
	</li>
	<li>
	  <para><lit>pcse</lit>: <lit>off</lit> (the default) or
	    <lit>on</lit>.  By default, when estimating a model using
	    pooled OLS on panel data with the <opt>robust</opt> option,
	    the Arellano estimator is used for the covariance matrix.  If
	    you set <lit>pcse</lit> to <quote>on</quote>, this forces use
	    of the Beck and Katz Panel Corrected Standard Errors (which do
	    not take autocorrelation into account).
	  </para>
	</li>
	<li>

    <description>
      <para>
	This command forces the program to interpret the current data
	set as having a specified structure.
      </para>
      <para>
	In the first form of the command the <repl>periodicity</repl>,
	which must be an integer, represents frequency in the case of
	time-series data (1 = annual; 4 = quarterly; 12 = monthly; 52 =
	weekly; 5, 6, or 7 = daily; 24 = hourly).  In the case of panel
	data the periodicity means the number of lines per data block:
	this corresponds to the number of cross-sectional units in the
	case of stacked cross-sections, or the number of time periods in
	the case of stacked time series.  In the case of simple
	cross-sectional data the periodicity should be set to 1.
      </para>
      <para>
	The starting observation represents the starting date in the
	case of time series data.  Years may be given with two or four
	digits; subperiods (for example, quarters or months) should be
	separated from the year with a colon.  In the case of panel
	data the starting observation should be given as 1:1; and in
	the case of cross-sectional data, as 1.  Starting observations
	for daily or weekly data should be given in the form
	YYYY-MM-DD (or simply as 1 for undated data).
      </para>
      <para>
	Certain time-series periodicities have standard
	interpretations&mdash;for example, 12 = monthly and 4 =
	quarterly. If you have unusual time-series data to which the
	standard interpretation does not apply, you can signal this by
	giving the <opt>special-time-series</opt> option. In that case
	gretl will not (for example) report your frequency-12 data as
	being monthly.
      </para>
      <para>
	If no explicit option flag is given to indicate the structure
	of the data the program will attempt to guess the structure
	from the information given.
      </para>
      <para>
	The second form of the command (which requires the
	<opt>panel-vars</opt> flag) may be used to impose a panel
	interpretation when the data set contains variables that uniquely
	identify the cross-sectional units and the time periods.  The data
	set will be sorted as stacked time series, by ascending values of
	the units variable, <repl>unitvar</repl>.
      </para>
      <subhead>Panel-specific options</subhead>
      <para>
	The <opt>panel-time</opt> and <opt>panel-groups</opt> options
	can only be used with a dataset which has already been defined
	as a panel.
      </para>
      <para>
	The purpose of <opt>panel-time</opt> is to set extra
	information regarding the time dimension of the panel. This
	should be given on the pattern of the first form of
	<lit>setobs</lit> noted above. For example, the following may
	be used to indicate that the time dimension of a panel is
	quarterly, starting in the first quarter of 1990.
      </para>
      <code>
	setobs 4 1990:1 --panel-time
      </code>
      <para>
	The purpose of <opt>panel-groups</opt> is to create a
	string-valued series holding names for the groups
	(individuals, cross-sectional units) in the panel. (This will
	be used where appropriate in panel graphs.) With this
	option you supply either one or two arguments as follows.
      </para>
      <para>
	First case: the (single) argument is the name of a
	string-valued series. If the number of distinct values equals
	the number of groups in the panel this series is used to
	define the group names. If necessary, the numerical content of
	the series will be adjusted such that the values are all 1s
	for the first group, all 2s for the second, and so on. If the
	number of string values doesn't match the number of groups an
	error is flagged.
      </para>
      <para>
	Second case: the first argument is the name of a series and
	the second is a string literal or variable holding a name for
	each group. The series will be created if it does not already
	exist. If the second argument is a string literal or string
	variable the group names should be separated by spaces; if a
	name includes spaces it should be wrapped in backslash-escaped
	double-quotes. Alternatively the second argument may be an
	array of strings.
      </para>
      <para>
	For example, the following will create a series named
	<lit>country</lit> in which the names in <lit>cstrs</lit> are
	each repeated <math>T</math> times, <math>T</math> being the
	time-series length of the panel.
      </para>
      <code>
	string cstrs = sprintf("France Germany Italy \"United Kingdom\"")
	setobs country cstrs --panel-groups
      </code>

    <description>
      <para>
	This command enables the pre-setting of options for a
	specified command. Ordinarily this is not required, but it may
	be useful for the writers of hansl functions when they wish to
	make certain command options conditional on the value of an
	argument supplied by the caller.
      </para>
      <para>
	For example, suppose a function offers a boolean
	<quote><lit>quiet</lit></quote> switch, whose intended effect
	is to suppress the printing of results from a certain
	regression executed within the function. In that case one
	might write:
      </para>
      <code>
	if quiet
	  setopt ols --quiet
	endif
	ols ...
      </code>
      <para>
	The <opt>quiet</opt> option will then be applied to the
	next <lit>ols</lit> command if and only if the variable
	<lit>quiet</lit> has a non-zero value.
      </para>
      <para>
	By default, options set in this way apply only to the
	following instance of <repl>command</repl>; they are not
	persistent. However if you give <lit>persist</lit> as the
	value for <repl>action</repl> the options will continue to
	apply to the given command until further notice.  The antidote
	to the <lit>persist</lit> action is <lit>clear</lit>: this
	erases any stored setting for the specified command.
      </para>
      <para>
	It should be noted that options set via <lit>setopt</lit> are
	compounded with any options attached to the target command
	directly. So for example one might append the
	<opt>hessian</opt> option to an <lit>mle</lit> command
	unconditionally but use <lit>setopt</lit> to add
	<opt>quiet</opt> conditionally.

	An exclamation mark, <cmd>!</cmd>, or the keyword

	shell commands can be executed from within

    <description>
      <para>
	Resets the sample range.  The new range can be defined in
	several ways.  In the first alternate form (and the first two
	examples) above, <repl>startobs</repl> and <repl>endobs</repl>
	must be consistent with the periodicity of the data.  Either
	one may be replaced by a semicolon to leave the value
	unchanged.  In the second form, the integers <repl>i</repl>
	and <repl>j</repl> (which may be positive or negative, and
	should be signed) are taken as offsets relative to the
	existing sample range. In the third form <repl>dummyvar</repl>
	must be an indicator variable with values 0 or 1 at each
	observation; the sample will be restricted to observations
	where the value is 1. The fourth form, using
	<opt>restrict</opt>, restricts the sample to observations
	that satisfy the given Boolean condition (which is specified
	according to the syntax of the <cmdref targ="genr"/> command).
      </para>

      <para>
	The options <opt>no-missing</opt> and
	<opt>no-all-missing</opt> may be used to exclude from the
	sample observations for which data are missing. The first
	variant excludes those rows in the dataset for which at least
	one variable has a missing value, while the second excludes
	just those rows on which <emphasis>all</emphasis> variables
	have missing values. In each case the test is confined to the
	variables in <repl>varlist</repl> if this argument is given,
	otherwise it is applied to all series&mdash;with the
	qualification that in the case of <opt>no-all-missing</opt>
	and no <repl>varlist</repl>, the generic variables
	<lit>index</lit> and <lit>time</lit> are ignored.
      </para>

      <para>
	The <opt>contiguous</opt> form of <lit>smpl</lit> is intended for
	use with time series data.  The effect is to trim any observations
	at the start and end of the current sample range that contain
	missing values (either for the variables in <repl>varlist</repl>, or
	for all data series if no <repl>varlist</repl> is given).  Then a
	check is performed to see if there are any missing values in the
	remaining range; if so, an error is flagged.
      </para>

      <para>
	With the <opt>random</opt> flag, the specified number of cases
	are selected from the current dataset at random (without
	replacement).  If you wish to be able to replicate this selection
	you should set the seed for the random number generator first (see
	the <cmdref targ="set"/> command).
      </para>

      <para>
	The final form, <lit>smpl full</lit>, restores the full data range.
      </para>

      <para>
	Note that sample restrictions are, by default, cumulative: the
	baseline for any <lit>smpl</lit> command is the current sample. If you
	wish the command to act so as to replace any existing restriction you
	can add the option flag <opt>replace</opt> to the end of the
	command. (But this option is not compatible with the
	<opt>contiguous</opt> option.)
      </para>

      <para>
	The internal variable <lit>obs</lit> may be used with the
	<opt>restrict</opt> form of <lit>smpl</lit> to exclude particular
	observations from the sample.  For example
      </para>

	One point should be noted about the <opt>dummy</opt>,
	<opt>restrict</opt> and <opt>no-missing</opt> forms of
	<lit>smpl</lit>: <quote>structural</quote> information in the data
	file (regarding the time series or panel nature of the data) is likely
	to be lost when this command is issued.  You may reimpose structure
	with the <cmdref targ="setobs"/> command.  A related option, for use
	with panel data, is the <opt>balanced</opt> flag: this requests that
	a balanced panel is reconstituted after sub-sampling, via the
	insertion of <quote>missing rows</quote> if need be.  But note that it
	is not always possible to comply with this request.  
      </para>

      <para>
	By default, restrictions on the current sample range are
	undoable: by doing <lit>smpl full</lit> you can restore
	the unrestricted dataset. However, the <opt>permanent</opt>
	flag can be used to substitute the restricted dataset for the
	original. This option is only available in conjunction
	with the <opt>restrict</opt>, <opt>dummy</opt>,
	<opt>no-missing</opt>, <opt>no-all-missing</opt> or
	<opt>random</opt> forms of <lit>smpl</lit>.

      <ilist>
	<li>
	  <para>
	    <lit>.gdt</lit>, or no extension: gretl's native XML

	  </para>
	</li>	
      </ilist>
      <para>
	The format-related option flags shown above can be used to
	force the issue of the save format independently of the
	filename (or to get gretl to write in the formats of PcGive or
	JMulTi). However, if <repl>filename</repl> has extension
	<lit>.gdt</lit> or <lit>.gdtb</lit> this necessarily implies
	use of native format and the addition of a conflicting
	option flag will generate an error.
      </para>
      <para>
	When data are saved in native format (only), the
	<opt>gzipped</opt> option may be used for data compression,
	which can be useful for large datasets. The optional parameter
	for this flag controls the level of compression (from 0 to 9):
	higher levels produce a smaller file, but compression takes
	longer. The default level is 1; a level of 0 means that no
	compression is applied.
      </para>
      <para>
	The option flags <opt>omit-obs</opt> and <opt>no-header</opt>
	are applicable only when saving data in CSV format.  By default,
	if the data are time series or panel, or if the dataset includes
	specific observation markers, the CSV file includes a first column
	identifying the observations (&eg; by date).  If the
	<opt>omit-obs</opt> flag is given this column is omitted. The
	<opt>no-header</opt> flag suppresses the usual printing of the
	names of the variables at the top of the columns.
      </para>
      <para>
	The option flag <opt>decimal-comma</opt> is also confined to
	the case of saving data in CSV format. The effect of this option
	is to replace the decimal point with the decimal comma; in
	addition the column separator is forced to be a semicolon.
      </para>
      <para>
	The option of saving in gretl database format is intended to help
	with the construction of large sets of series, possibly having
	mixed frequencies and ranges of observations.  At present this
	option is available only for annual, quarterly or monthly
	time-series data. If you save to a file that already exists, the
	default action is to append the newly saved series to the existing
	content of the database.  In this context it is an error if one or
	more of the variables to be saved has the same name as a variable
	that is already present in the database. The
	<opt>overwrite</opt> flag has the effect that, if there are
	variable names in common, the newly saved variable replaces the
	variable of the same name in the original dataset. 
      </para>
      <para>
	The <opt>comment</opt> option is available when saving data
	as a database or in CSV format. The required parameter is a
	double-quoted one-line string, attached to the option flag
	with an equals sign. The string is inserted as a comment into
	the database index file or at the top of the CSV output.
      </para>
      <para>
	The <lit>store</lit> command behaves in a special manner in
	the context of a <quote>progressive loop</quote>.  See
	<guideref targ="chap:looping"/> for details.

      <para context="cli">
	To save the system you should assign it a name, as in the first

	equations, you are able to impose restrictions (including
	cross-equation restrictions) using the <cmdref
	targ="restrict"/> command.

      <para context="cli">
	Alternatively you can specify an estimator for the system
	using <lit>method=</lit> followed by a string identifying one

      </para>

      <para>
	Output for two-stage least squares estimates includes the Hausman
	test and, if the model is over-identified, the Sargan
	over-identification test.  In the Hausman test, the null
	hypothesis is that OLS estimates are consistent, or in other words
	estimation by means of instrumental variables is not really
	required.  A model of this sort is over-identified if there are
	more instruments than are strictly required.  The Sargan test is
	based on an auxiliary regression of the residuals from the
	two-stage least squares model on the full list of instruments.
	The null hypothesis is that all the instruments are valid, and
	suspicion is thrown on this hypothesis if the auxiliary regression
	has a significant degree of explanatory power. For a good
	explanation of both tests see chapter 8 of <cite
	key="davidson-mackinnon04">Davidson and MacKinnon (2004)</cite>.

	instruments can lead to serious problems in IV regression: biased
	estimates and/or incorrect size of hypothesis tests based on the
	covariance matrix, with rejection rates well in excess of the
	nominal significance level <cite key="stock-wright-yogo02"
	p="true">(Stock, Wright and Yogo, 2002)</cite>.  The test
	statistic is the first-stage <math>F</math>-test if the model

	smallest eigenvalue of the matrix counterpart of the first stage

	A VECM is a form of vector autoregression or VAR (see <cmdref
	  targ="var"/>), applicable where the variables in the model are
	individually integrated of order 1 (that is, are random walks, with or
	without drift), but exhibit cointegration.  This command is closely
	related to the Johansen test for cointegration (see <cmdref
	  targ="coint2"/>).
