  <sect1 id="johansen-test"><title>The Johansen cointegration test</title>

    <para>
      The Johansen test for cointegration has to take into account what
      hypotheses one is willing to make on the deterministic terms, which leads
      to the famous <quote>five cases.</quote> A full and general illustration
      of the five cases requires a fair amount of matrix algebra, but an
      intuitive understanding of the issue can be gained by means of a simple
      example. 
    </para>

    <para>
      Consider a series &xt; which behaves as follows
      <equation id="vecm1"><alt role="tex">
	  \[ x_t = m + x_{t-1} + \varepsilon_t \]
	</alt><graphic fileref="figures/vecm1"/>
      </equation> where <mathvar>m</mathvar> is a real number and
      &varepsilon;<mathvar><subscript>t</subscript></mathvar> is a white noise
      process. As is easy to show, &xt; is a random walk which fluctuates around
      a deterministic trend with slope <mathvar>m</mathvar>. In the special
      case <mathvar>m</mathvar> = 0, the deterministic trend disappears and
      &xt; is a pure random walk.
    </para>

    <para>
      Consider now another process &yt;, defined by 
      <informalequation><alt role="tex">
	  \[ y_t = k + x_t + u_t \]
	</alt><graphic fileref="figures/vecm2"/>
      </informalequation> where, again, <mathvar>k</mathvar> is a real number
      and &ut; is a white noise process. Since &ut; is stationary by definition,
      &xt; and &yt; cointegrate: that is, their difference 
      <inlineequation><alt role="tex">
	  $z_t = y_t - x_t = k + u_t$
	</alt><graphic fileref="figures/vecm2a"/>
      </inlineequation>
      is a stationary process. For <mathvar>k</mathvar> = 0, &zt; is simple zero-mean
      white noise, whereas for <mathvar>k</mathvar> &ne; 0 the process &zt; is
      white noise with a non-zero mean.
  </para>

    <para>
      After some simple substitutions, the two equations above can be represented
      jointly as a VAR(1) system
      <informalequation><alt role="tex">

      </informalequation>
      where &beta; is the cointegration vector and &alpha; is the
      <quote>loadings</quote> or <quote>adjustments</quote> vector.
    </para>

    <para> 
      We are now in a position to consider three possible cases:
    </para>

    <orderedlist>
      <listitem>
	<para>
	  <mathvar>m</mathvar> &ne; 0: In this case &xt; is trended, as we
	  just saw; it follows that &yt; also follows a linear trend because on
	  average it keeps at a distance <mathvar>k</mathvar> from &xt;. The
	  vector &mu;<subscript>0</subscript> is unrestricted.  This case is
	  the default for gretl's <xref linkend="cmd-vecm"/> command.
	</para>
      </listitem>
      <listitem>
	<para>
	  <mathvar>m</mathvar> = 0 and <mathvar>k</mathvar> &ne; 0: 
	  In this case, &xt; is not trended and as a
	  consequence neither is &yt;. However, the mean distance between &yt;
	  and &xt; is non-zero. The vector &mu;<subscript>0</subscript> is given by
	  <informalequation><alt role="tex">
\renewcommand{\arraystretch}{1.3}
\setlength{\arraycolsep}{.05in}
	      \[
	      \mu_0 = \left[  \begin{array}{c} k \\ 0 \end{array} \right]
	      \]
	    </alt><graphic fileref="figures/vecm5"/>
	  </informalequation>
	  which is not null and therefore the VECM shown above
	  does have a constant term. The constant, however, is subject to the
	  restriction that its second element must be 0. More generally,
	  &mu;<subscript>0</subscript> is a multiple of the vector &alpha;. Note that the VECM
	  could also be written as
	  <informalequation><alt role="tex">
\renewcommand{\arraystretch}{1.3}
\setlength{\arraycolsep}{.05in}
   \[
     \left[  \begin{array}{c} \Delta y_t \\ \Delta x_t \end{array} \right]  =  
     \left[  \begin{array}{r} -1 \\ 0 \end{array} \right]
     \left[  \begin{array}{rrr} 1 & -1 & -k \end{array} \right] 
     \left[  \begin{array}{c} y_{t-1} \\ x_{t-1} \\ 1 \end{array} \right] + 
     \left[  \begin{array}{c} u_t + \varepsilon_t \\ \varepsilon_t  \end{array} \right]
   \]
	   </alt><graphic fileref="figures/vecm6"/>   
	  </informalequation>
	  which incorporates the intercept into the cointegration
	  vector. This is known as the <quote>restricted constant</quote> case;
	  it may be specified in gretl's <xref linkend="cmd-vecm"/> command using
	  the option flag <literal>--rc</literal>.
	</para>
      </listitem>
      <listitem>
	<para>
	  <mathvar>m</mathvar> = 0 and <mathvar>k</mathvar> = 0: This case
	  is the most restrictive: clearly, neither &xt; nor &yt; are trended,
	  and the mean distance between them is zero. The vector
	  &mu;<subscript>0</subscript> is also 0, which explains why this case
	  is referred to as <quote>no constant.</quote>  This case is specified
	  using the option flag <literal>--nc</literal> with
	  <xref linkend="cmd-vecm"/>.
	</para>
      </listitem>
    </orderedlist>

    <para>
      In most cases, the choice between the three possibilities is based on a
      mix of empirical observation and economic reasoning. If the variables
      under consideration seem to follow a linear trend then we should not
      place any restriction on the intercept. Otherwise, the question arises of
      whether it makes sense to specify a cointegration relationship which
      includes a non-zero intercept. One example where this is appropriate is the
      relationship between two interest rates: generally these are not trended,
      but the VAR might still have an intercept because the difference between
      the two (the <quote>interest rate spread</quote>) might be stationary
      around a non-zero mean (for example, because of a risk or liquidity
      premium).
    </para>

    <para>
      The previous example can be generalized in three directions:
    </para>

    <orderedlist>
      <listitem>
	<para>
	  If a VAR of order greater than 1 is considered, the algebra gets
	  more convoluted but the conclusions are identical.
	</para>
      </listitem>
      <listitem>
	<para>
	  If the VAR includes more than two endogenous variables the
	  cointegration rank <mathvar>r</mathvar> can be greater than 1. In
	  this case, &alpha; is a matrix with <mathvar>r</mathvar> columns,
	  and the case with restricted constant entails the restriction that
	  &mu;<subscript>0</subscript> should be some linear combination of the
	  columns of &alpha;.
	</para>
      </listitem>
      <listitem>
	<para>
	  If a linear trend is included in the model, the deterministic part of
	  the VAR becomes &mu;<subscript>0</subscript> +
	  &mu;<subscript>1</subscript><mathvar>t</mathvar>. The reasoning is
	  practically the same as above except that the focus now centers on
	  &mu;<subscript>1</subscript> rather than &mu;<subscript>0</subscript>.
	  The counterpart to the <quote>restricted constant</quote> case
	  discussed above is a <quote>restricted trend</quote> case, such that
	  the cointegration relationships include a trend but the first
	  differences of the variables in question do not. In the case of an
	  unrestricted trend, the trend appears in both the cointegration
	  relationships and the first differences, which corresponds to the
	  presence of a quadratic trend in the variables themselves (in levels).
	  These two cases are specified by the option flags
	  <literal>--crt</literal> and <literal>--ct</literal>, respectively,
	  with the <xref
	    linkend="cmd-vecm"/> command.
	</para>
