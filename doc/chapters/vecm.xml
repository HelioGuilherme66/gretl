  <sect1 id="johansen-test"><title>The Johansen cointegration test</title>

    <para>
      The Johansen test for cointegration has to take into account what
      hypotheses one is willing to make on the deterministic terms, which leads
      to the famous <quote>five cases.</quote> A full and general illustration
      of the five cases requires a fair amount of matrix algebra, but an
      intuitive understanding of the issue can be gained by means of a simple
      example. 
    </para>

    <para>
    Suppose we observe a series $x_t$, which is a random walk with drift,
      <informalequation><alt role="tex">
	\[ x_t = m + x_{t-1} + \varepsilon_t \]
	</alt><graphic fileref="figures/vecm1"/>
      </informalequation>
      where $m$ is a real number and $\varepsilon_t$ is a white noise process.
      As is easy to show, $x_t$ is a random walk which fluctuates around
      a deterministic trend with slope $m$. In the special case $m=0$,
      the deterministic trend disappears and $x_t$ is a pure random walk.
    </para>

    <para>
      Consider now another process $y_t$, defined by 
      <informalequation><alt role="tex">
	  \[ y_t = k + x_t + u_t \]
	</alt><graphic fileref="figures/vecm2"/>
      </informalequation>
      where, again, $k$ is
      a real number and $u_t$ is a white noise process. Since $u_t$ is stationary
      by definition, $x_t$ and $y_t$ cointegrate, since their difference $z_t =
      y_t - x_t$ is a stationary process. For $k = 0$, $z_t$ is simply a white
      noise, whereas for $k \ne 0$ the process $z_t$ is a white noise with
      non-zero mean.
  </para>

    <para>
      After some simple substitutions, the two equations above can be represented
      together as a VAR(1) system:
      <informalequation><alt role="tex">
	\[ \left[  \begin{array}{c} y_t \\ x_t \end{array} \right] = \left[
	\begin{array}{c} k + m \\ m \end{array} \right] + \left[
	\begin{array}{rr} 0 & 1 \\ 0 & 1 \end{array} \right] \left[
	\begin{array}{c} y_{t-1} \\ x_{t-1} \end{array} \right] + \left[
	\begin{array}{c} u_t + \varepsilon_t \\ \varepsilon_t \end{array}
	\right] \]
	</alt><graphic fileref="figures/vecm3"/>
      </informalequation>
      or in VECM form
      <informalequation><alt role="tex">
\begin{eqnarray*}
  \left[  \begin{array}{c} \Delta y_t \\ \Delta x_t \end{array} \right]  & = & 
    \left[  \begin{array}{c} k + m \\ m \end{array} \right] +
    \left[  \begin{array}{rr} -1 & 1 \\ 0 & 0 \end{array} \right] 
    \left[  \begin{array}{c} y_{t-1} \\ x_{t-1} \end{array} \right] + 
    \left[  \begin{array}{c} u_t + \varepsilon_t \\ \varepsilon_t \end{array} \right] = \\
  & = & 
    \left[  \begin{array}{c} k + m \\ m \end{array} \right] +
    \left[  \begin{array}{r} -1 \\ 0 \end{array} \right]
    \left[  \begin{array}{rr} 1 & -1 \end{array} \right] 
    \left[  \begin{array}{c} y_{t-1} \\ x_{t-1} \end{array} \right] + 
    \left[  \begin{array}{c} u_t + \varepsilon_t \\ \varepsilon_t \end{array} \right] = \\
  & = & 
    \mu_0 + \alpha \beta' \left[  \begin{array}{c} y_{t-1} \\ x_{t-1} \end{array} \right] + \eta_t = 
    \mu_0 + \alpha z_{t-1} + \eta_t ,
\end{eqnarray*}
	</alt><graphic fileref="figures/vecm4"/>
      </informalequation>
      where &beta; is the cointegration vector and &alpha; is the
      <quote>loadings</quote> or <quote>adjustments</quote> vector.
    </para>

    <para> 
      We are now in the position of considering three different cases:
    </para>

    <orderedlist>
      <listitem>
	<para>
	  $m \ne 0$: In this case, $x_t$ is trended, as we just saw; it follows
	  (from equation (\ref{eq:ytcoint})) that $y_t$ also follows a linear
	  trend, because on average it keeps at a distance $k$ from $x_t$. The
	  vector $\mu_0$ is unrestricted.
	</para>
      </listitem>
      <listitem>
	<para>
	  $m = 0$ and $k \ne 0$: In this case, $x_t$ is not trended, and as a
	  consequence neither $y_t$ is. However, the mean distance between $y_t$
	  and $x_t$ is non-zero. The vector $\mu_0$ equals
	  <informalequation><alt role="tex">
	      \[
	      \mu_0 = \left[  \begin{array}{c} k \\ 0 \end{array} \right]
	      \]
	    </alt><graphic fileref="figures/vecm5"/>
	  </informalequation>
	  which is not null and therefore the VECM in equation (\ref{eq:VAR})
	  does have a constant term. The constant, however, is subject to the
	  restriction that its second element must be 0. More in general,
	  &mu;<subscript>0</subscript> is a multiple of the vector &alpha;. Note that the VECM
	  could also be written as
	  <informalequation><alt role="tex">
   \[
     \left[  \begin{array}{c} \Delta y_t \\ \Delta x_t \end{array} \right]  =  
     \left[  \begin{array}{r} -1 \\ 0 \end{array} \right]
     \left[  \begin{array}{rrr} 1 & -1 & -k \end{array} \right] 
     \left[  \begin{array}{c} y_{t-1} \\ x_{t-1} \\ 1 \end{array} \right] + 
     \left[  \begin{array}{c} u_t + \varepsilon_t \\ \varepsilon_t  \end{array} \right] ,
   \]
	   </alt><graphic fileref="figures/vecm6"/>   
	  </informalequation>
	  which incorporates the intercept into the cointegration
	  vector. This is known as the <quote>restricted constant</quote> case.
	</para>
      </listitem>
      <listitem>
	<para>
	  $m = 0$ and $k = 0$: This case is the most restrictive: clearly,
	  neither $x_t$ nor $y_t$ are trended, and the mean distance between
	  them is zero. The vector &mu;<subscript>0</subscript> is also 0, which
	  explains why this case is referred to as <quote>no constant.</quote>
	</para>
      </listitem>
    </orderedlist>

    <para>
      In most cases, the choice between the three possibilities is based on a
      mix of empirical observation and economic reasoning. If the two series
      under consideration seem to follow a linear trend, then restrictions on
      the intercept must be ruled out. If not, the question arises on whether it
      makes sense to specify a cointegration relationship which includes an
      intercept. The classic case when this applies arises when we consider two
      interest rates: normally these are not trended, but the VAR might still
      have an intercept, because the difference between the two (the
      <quote>interest rate spread</quote>) might be stationary around a non-zero
      mean (for example, because of a risk or liquidity premium).
    </para>

    <para>
      The previous example can be generalized in three directions:
    </para>

    <orderedlist>
      <listitem>
	<para>
	  If a VAR of order greater than 1 is considered, the algebra gets
	  more convoluted but the conclusions are identical.
	</para>
      </listitem>
      <listitem>
	<para>
	  If we consider a VAR that includes more than two endogenous variables
	  the cointegration rank <emphasis>r</emphasis> can be greater than 1.
	  In this case, &alpha; is a matrix with <emphasis>r</emphasis> columns,
	  and the case with restricted constant entails the restriction that
	  &mu;<subscript>0</subscript> should be some linear combination of the
	  columns of &alpha;.
	</para>
      </listitem>
      <listitem>
	<para>
	  If a linear trend is included, the deterministic part of the VAR
	  becomes &mu;<subscript>0</subscript> +
	  &mu;<subscript>1</subscript><emphasis>t</emphasis>. The reasoning is
	  practically the same, except that the focus now centers on
	  &mu;<subscript>1</subscript> rather than &mu;<subscript>0</subscript>,
	  so with &mu;<subscript>1</subscript> unrestricted the series follow a
	  quadratic trend, while &mu;<subscript>1</subscript> restricted implies
	  that the observed series follow a linear trend and the cointegration
	  relationships also include a trend.
	</para>
      </listitem>
    </orderedlist>
