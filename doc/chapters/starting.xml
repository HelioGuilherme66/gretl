  <chapter id="getting-started"><title>Getting started</title>

    <para>This introduction is mostly angled towards the graphical
      client program; please see <xref linkend="cmdref"/> and
      <xref linkend="cli"/>  below for details on the command-line
      program, <application>gretlcli</application>.
    </para>

    <para>
      You can supply the name of a data file to open as an argument to
      <application>gretl</application>, but for the moment let's not
      do that: just fire up the program.<footnote><para>For
      convenience I will refer to the graphical client program simply
      as <application>gretl</application> in this manual.  Note,
      however, that the specific name of the program differs according
      to the computer platform.  On unix-like systems it is called
      <filename>gretl_x11</filename> while on MS Windows it is
      <filename>gretlw32.exe</filename>. On unix-like systems a
      wrapper script named <filename>gretl</filename> is also
      installed &mdash; see also <xref
      linkend="optarg"/>.</para></footnote> You should see a main
      window (which will hold information on the data set but which is
      at first blank) and various menus, some of them disabled at
      first.
    </para>

    <para>
      What can you do at this point?  You can browse the supplied data
      files (or databases), open a data file, create a new data file,
      read the help items, or open a command script.  For now let's
      browse the supplied data files.  Under the File menu choose
      <quote>Open data, sample file, Ramanathan&hellip;</quote>.  A
      second window should open, presenting a list of data files
      supplied with the package (see <xref linkend="fig-datafiles"/>).
      The numbering of the files corresponds to the chapter
      organization of Ramanathan (2002), which contains discussion of
      the analysis of these data. The data will be useful for practice
      purposes even without the text.

    <para>
      If you select a row in this window and click on
      <quote>Info</quote> this pops open the the <quote>header
	file</quote> for the data set in question, which tells you
      something about the source and definition of the variables.  If
      you find a file that is of interest, you may open it by clicking
      on <quote>Open</quote>, or just double-clicking on the file
      name.  For the moment let's open <filename>data3-6</filename>.
    </para>

    <tip>
      <para>In <application>gretl</application> windows containing
	lists, double-clicking on a line launches a default action for
	the associated list entry: e.g. displaying the values of a
	data series, opening a file.</para>
    </tip>

    <para>
      This file contains data pertaining to a classic econometric
      <quote>chestnut</quote>, the consumption function.  The data
      window should now display the name of the current data file, the
      overall data range and sample range, and the names of the
      variables along with brief descriptive tags &mdash; see
      <xref linkend="fig-mainwin"/>.
    </para>

    </figure>

    <para>
      OK, what can we do now?  Hopefully the various menu options
      should be fairly self explanatory.  For now we'll dip into the
      Model menu; a brief tour of all the main window menus is given
      in <xref linkend="menus"/> below.
    </para>

    <para>
      <application>gretl</application>'s Model menu offers numerous
      various econometric estimation routines.  The simplest and most
      standard is Ordinary Least Squares (OLS).</para>

    <para>Selecting OLS pops up a dialog box calling for a
      <emphasis>model specification</emphasis>.  This takes the form
      of a list of variable names or numbers, separated by spaces.
      The first name or number represents the dependent variable, the
      remainder the independent variables.  It is usual to include a
      constant (ID number 0) among the independent variables
      (otherwise you are forcing the intercept to equal zero).
    </para>

    <tip><para>You can put a variable's ID number into the dialog box
	by clicking on that variable's row in the main
	window.</para></tip>

    <para>Thus, continuing the example of
      <filename>data3-6</filename>, the entry <command>1 0 2</command>
      (or equivalently <command>Ct 0 Yt</command>) specifies a
      regression of consumption (dependent) on income and a constant.
    </para>

    <para>You can specify a lagged value of an existing variable
      without explicitly adding this to the data set first.  Thus a
      variant on the above estimation command which includes the first
      lag of income on the right-hand side would be <command>1 0 2
	Yt(-1)</command> The lag is selected using a negative integer
      enclosed in parentheses. Note that in this context the name, not
      the number, of the variable in question must be used.
    </para>

    <sect1 id="est-output"><title>Estimation output</title>

    <para>
      Once you've specified a model, a window displaying the
      regression output will appear.  The output is reasonably
      comprehensive and in a standard format (<xref 
	  linkend="fig-modelwin"/>).
    </para>  

    <figure id="fig-modelwin" float="1" pgwide="1">
     <title>Model output window</title>
     <screenshot>
	<screeninfo>Model window</screeninfo>
	<graphic fileref="figures/modelwin.png" align="center"/>
     </screenshot>
    </figure>

    <para>The output window contains menus that allow you to inspect
      or graph the residuals and fitted values, and to run various
      diagnostic tests on the model.</para>  

    <para>There is also an option to reprint the regression output in
      &latex; format.  This is not fully implemented yet, but works
      for OLS models.  You can print the results in a tabular format
      (similar to what's in the output window, but properly typeset)
      or as an equation, across the page.  For each of these options
      you can choose to preview the typeset product, or save the
      output to file for incorporation in a &latex; document.
      Previewing requires that you have a functioning &tex; system on
      your computer.</para> 

    <para>If you want to import <application>gretl</application>
      output into an editor or word processor there are two main
      options.  You can simply copy and paste from an output window
      (using its <guimenuitem>Edit</guimenuitem> menu) to the target
      program, or you can save the output to a file then import the
      file into the target program.  When you finish a
      <application>gretl</application> session you are given the
      option of saving all the output from the session to a single
      file.</para>

    <tip><para>When inserting <application>gretl</application> output
	into a word processor, select a monospaced or typewriter-style
	font (e.g. Courier) to preserve the output's tabular
	formatting.  Select a small font (10-point Courier should do)
	to prevent the output lines from being broken in the wrong
	place.</para></tip>
