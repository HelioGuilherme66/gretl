    <para>
      As I steer <application>gretl</application> towards a
      <quote>stable</quote> release (version 1.0) I welcome any
      reports of bugs in the program.  I think you are unlikely to
      find bugs in the actual calculations done by
      <application>gretl</application> (although this statement does
      not constitute any sort of warranty). You may, however, come
      across bugs or oddities in the behavior of the graphical
      interface.  Please remember that the usefulness of bug reports
      is greatly enhanced if you can be as specific as possible: what
      <emphasis>exactly</emphasis> went wrong, under what conditions,
      and on what operating system?  If you saw an error message, what
      precisely did it say?  (You needn't bother, though, to quote the
      memory address numbers given in any crash reports from MS
      Windows &mdash; these won't mean anything to me.)</para>

    <para>
      As mentioned above, <application>gretl</application> calls some
      other programs to accomplish certain tasks (gnuplot for
      graphing, &latex; for high-quality typesetting of regression
      output, GNU R).  If something goes wrong with such external
      links, it is not always easy to produce an informative error
      message window.  If such a link fails when accessed from the
      <application>gretl</application> graphical interface, you may be
      able to get more information by starting
      <application>gretl</application> from the command prompt (e.g.
      from an xterm under the X window system, or from a <quote>DOS
	box</quote> under MS Windows, in which case type
      <command>gretlw32.exe</command>), rather than via a desktop menu
      entry or icon.  Additional error messages may be displayed on
      the terminal window.</para>

    <para>
      Also please note that for most external calls,
      <application>gretl</application> assumes that the programs in
      question are available in your <quote>path</quote> &mdash; that
      is, that they can be invoked simply via the name of the program,
      without supplying the program's full location.<footnote><para>The
      exception to this rule is the invocation of gnuplot under MS
      Windows, where a full path to the program is given.</para>
      </footnote>  Thus if a
      given program fails, try the experiment of typing the program
      name at the command prompt, as shown below.</para>

    <para>
      If the program fails to start from the prompt, it's not a
      <application>gretl</application> issue but rather that the
      program's home directory is not in your path, or the program is
      not installed (properly).  For details on modifying your path
      please see the documentation or online help for your operating
      system or shell.
