    <para>
      <application>gretl</application> is an econometrics package,
      including a shared library, a command-line client program and a
      graphical user interface.

    <variablelist>
      <varlistentry><term>User-friendly</term>
	<listitem><para><application>gretl</application> offers an
	    intuitive user interface; it is very easy to get up and
	    running with econometric analysis. Thanks to its
	    association with Ramanathan's <citetitle>Introductory
	      Econometrics</citetitle> the package offers many
	    practice data files and command scripts.  These are well
	    annotated and accessible.</para>

	    running Monte Carlo analyses or iterated least squares
	    estimation of non-linear models.  While it does not
	    include all the estimators and tests that a professional

    <para>
      My primary debt is to Professor Ramu Ramanathan of the
      University of California, San Diego.  A few years back he was
      kind enough to provide me with the source code for his program
      <application>ESL</application> (<quote>Econometrics Software
	Library</quote>), which I ported to Linux, and since then I
      have collaborated with him on updating and extending the
      program.  For the <application>gretl</application> project I
      have made extensive changes to the original
      <application>ESL</application> code.  New econometric
      functionality has been added, and the graphical interface is
      entirely new. Please note that Professor Ramanathan is not
      responsible for any bugs in <application>gretl</application>.

    <para>
      I am grateful to William Greene, author of
      <citetitle>Econometric Analysis</citetitle>, for permission to
      include in the <application>gretl</application> distribution
      some of the data sets analysed in his text, and to Jeffrey
      Wooldridge for helping me prepare a
      <application>gretl</application> version of the data sets from
      his <citetitle>Introductory Econometrics: A Modern
      Approach</citetitle>.

    <para>With regard to the internationalization of
      <application>gretl</application>, I wish to thank Ignacio
      D&iacute;az-Emperanza and Michel Robitaille, who prepared the
      Spanish and French translations respectively.</para>

    <para>I have benefitted greatly from the work of numerous
      developers of open-source software: for specifics please see
      <xref linkend="app-technote"/> to this manual. My thanks are due
      to Richard Stallman of the Free Software Foundation, for his
      support of free software in general and for agreeing to
      <quote>adopt</quote> <application>gretl</application> as a GNU
      program in particular.</para>

	    What is said herein about Linux mostly applies to other
	    unix-type systems too, though some local modifications may
	    be needed.</para></footnote> platform you have the choice
	of compiling the <application>gretl</application> code
	yourself or making use of a pre-built package. Ready-to-run
	packages are available in <application>rpm</application>
	format (suitable for Red Hat Linux and related systems) and
	also <application>deb</application> format (Debian GNU/Linux).
	I am grateful to Dirk Eddelb&uuml;ttel for making the latter.
	If you prefer to compile your own (or are using a unix system
	for which pre-built packages are not available) here is what
	to do.

      <para>As of version 0.97 <application>gretl</application> offers
	support for the <application>gnome</application> desktop.  To
	take advantage of this you should compile the program yourself
	(as described above).  If you want to suppress the
	<application>gnome</application>-specific features you can

    <sect2 id="windows-install"><title>MS Windows</title>

      <para>
	The MS Windows version comes as a self-extracting executable.
	Installation is just a matter of downloading
	<filename>gretl_install.exe</filename> and running this
	program. You will be prompted for a location to install the
	package (the default is
	<filename>c:\userdata\gretl</filename>).  </para>

    <sect2 id="updating"><title>Updating</title>

      <para>
	If your computer is connected to the Internet, then on
	start-up <application>gretl</application> can query its home
	website at Wake Forest University to see if any program
	updates are available; if so, a window will open up informing
	you of that fact.  If you want to activate this feature, check
	the box marked <quote>Tell me about gretl updates</quote>
	under <application>gretl</application>'s <quote>File,
	  Preferences, General</quote> menu.
      </para>

      <para>
	The MS Windows version of the program goes a step further: it
	tells you that you can update <application>gretl</application>
	automatically if you wish.  To do this, follow the
	instructions in the popup window: close
	<application>gretl</application> then run the program titled
	<quote>gretl updater</quote> (you should find this along with
	the main <application>gretl</application> program item, under
	the Programs heading in the Windows Start menu). Once the
	updater has completed its work you may restart
	<application>gretl</application>.
