    <title>About gretl</title>

    <para>Gretl is an open-source, cross-platform econometrics
    program.  Its development is hosted by <ulink

    <title>The NIST reference datasets</title>
  
    <para>
      The U.S. National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST)
      publishes a set of statistical reference datasets.  The object
      of this project is to <quote>improve the accuracy of statistical
	software by providing reference datasets with certified
	computational results that enable the objective evaluation of
	statistical software</quote>.</para>

    <para>As of May 2000 the website for the project can be found
      at:</para>

    <para><ulink
	url="http://www.nist.gov/itl/div898/strd/general/main.html">
	<literal>http://www.nist.gov/itl/div898/strd/general/main.html</literal></ulink></para>

    <para>while the datasets are at</para>

    <para><ulink

	<literal>http://www.nist.gov/itl/div898/strd/general/dataarchive.html</literal></ulink></para>

    <para>For testing <application>gretl</application> I have made use
      of the datasets pertaining to Linear Regression and Univariate
      Summary Statistics (the others deal with ANOVA and nonlinear
      regression).</para>

    <para>I quote from the NIST text <quote>Certification Method &amp;
	Definitions</quote> regarding their certified computational
      results (emphasis added):</para>

    <blockquote>
      <para>For all datasets, multiple precision calculations
	(accurate to 500 digits) were made using the preprocessor and
	FORTRAN subroutine package of Bailey (1995, available from
	NETLIB). Data were read in exactly as multiple precision
	numbers and all calculations were made with this very high
	precision. The results were output in multiple precision, and
	only then rounded to fifteen significant digits.
	<emphasis>These multiple precision results are an
	  idealization. They represent what would be achieved if
	  calculations were made without roundoff or other
	  errors.</emphasis> Any typical numerical algorithm (i.e.
	not implemented in multiple precision) will introduce
	computational inaccuracies, and will produce results which
	differ slightly from these certified values.</para>
    </blockquote>

    <para>It is not to be expected that results obtained from ordinary
      statistical packages will agree exactly with NIST's multiple
      precision benchmark figures.  But the benchmark provides a very
      useful test for egregious errors and imprecision.</para>

    <title>Gretl's performance</title>

    <para><xref linkend="tab-linreg"/> below shows the performance of
    both gretl's standard regression facility and the gretl plugin
    based on the Gnu Multiple Precision (GMP) library.  In the Gretl
    column the <quote>min. correct significant digits</quote> figure
    shows, for each model, the least number of correct significant
    digits in the gretl results when the various statistics associated
    with the model (regression coefficients and standard errors, sum
    of squared residuals, standard error of residuals,
    <emphasis>F</emphasis> statistic and &rsqu;) are compared with the
    NIST certified values.  The GMP plugin column simply records
    whether the gretl results were correct to at least 12 sigificant
    figures for all the statistics.</para>

    </table>


    <para>As can be seen from the table,
      <application>gretl</application> does a good job of tracking the
      certified results. With the <filename>Filip</filename> data set,
      where the model is
      <informalequation>
	<alt role="tex">
	  \[y_t=\beta_0+\beta_1 x_t+\beta_2 x^2_t+\beta_3 x^3_t+\cdots
	  +\beta_{10}x^{10}_t+\epsilon\]
	</alt>
	<graphic fileref="figures/poly.png"/>
      </informalequation>
      <application>gretl</application> refuses to produce estimates
      due to a high degree of multicollinearity (the popular
      commercial econometrics program <citetitle>Eviews
	3.1</citetitle> also baulks at this regression).  Other than
      that, the program produces accurate coefficient estimates in all
      cases.</para>

    <para>In the <filename>NoInt1</filename> and
      <filename>NoInt2</filename> datasets there is a methodological
      disagreement over the calculation of the coefficient of
      determination, &rsqu;, where the regression does not have an
      intercept. <application>gretl</application> reports the square
      of the correlation coefficient between the fitted and actual
      values of the dependent variable in this case, while the NIST
      figure is 
      <informalequation>
      <alt role="tex"> 
	\[R^2 = 1 - \frac{\mathrm{ESS}}{\sum y^2}\] 
      </alt>
	  <graphic fileref="figures/nistr2.png"/>  
      </informalequation>
      There is no universal agreement among statisticians on the
      <quote>correct</quote> formula (see for instance the discussion
      in Ramanathan, 2002, pp. 163&ndash;4). <citetitle>Eviews
	3.1</citetitle> produces a different figure again (which has a
      negative value for the <filename>NoInt</filename> test files).
      The figure chosen by NIST was obtained for these regressions
      using the command</para>

    <para><command> genr r2alt = 1 - $ess/sum(y * y)
    </command></para>

    <para>and the numbers thus obtained were in agreement with the
      certified values, up to <application>gretl</application>'s
      precision.</para>

    <para>
      As for the univariate summary statistics, the certified
      values given by NIST are for the sample mean, sample standard
      deviation and sample lag-1 autocorrelation coefficient.  NIST
      note that the latter statistic <quote>may have several
	definitions</quote>. The certified value is computed as 

      <informalequation>
	<alt role="tex">
	  \[r_1=\frac{\sum^T_{t=2}(y_t-\bar{y})(y_{t-1}-\bar{y})} 
                     {\sum^T_{t=1}(y_t - \bar{y})^2}\]
	</alt>
	<graphic fileref="figures/nistr1.png"/>
      </informalequation>
      
      while <application>gretl</application>
      gives the correlation coefficient between 
      <emphasis>y</emphasis><subscript><emphasis>t</emphasis></subscript>
      and
      <emphasis>y</emphasis><subscript><emphasis>t</emphasis>&minus;1</subscript>.
      For the purposes of comparison, the NIST figure was computed
      within <application>gretl</application> as follows:</para>

    <programlisting>
      genr y1 = y(-1) 
      genr ybar = mean(y) 
      genr devy = y - ybar genr
      devy1 = y1 - ybar 
      genr ssy = sum(devy * devy) 
      smpl 2 ; 
      genr ssyy1 = sum(devy * devy1) 
      genr rnist = ssyy1 / ssy</programlisting>

    <para>The figure <varname>rnist</varname> was then compared with the
      certified value.
    </para>

    <para>With this modification, all the summary statistics were in
      agreement (to the precision given by
      <application>gretl</application>) for all datasets
      (<filename>PiDigits</filename>, <filename>Lottery</filename>,
      <filename>Lew</filename>, <filename>Mavro</filename>,
      <filename>Michelso</filename>, <filename>NumAcc1</filename>,
      <filename>NumAcc2</filename>, <filename>NumAcc3</filename> and
      <filename>NumAcc4</filename>).</para>
