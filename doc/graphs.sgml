    <para>A separate program, namely gnuplot, is called to generate
      graphs. Gnuplot is a very full-featured graphing program with
      myriad options. It is available from <ulink
	url="http://www.gnuplot.org/">gnuplot.org</ulink> (but note
      that a copy of gnuplot is bundled with the MS Windows version of
      <application>gretl</application>).
      <application>gretl</application> gives you direct access, via a
      graphical interface, to only a small subset of gnuplot's options
      but it tries to choose sensible values for you; it also allows
      you to take complete control over graph details if you
      wish.</para>

    <para>Under MS Windows you can click at the top left corner of a
      graph window for a pull-down gnuplot menu that lets you choose
      various things (including copying the graph to the Windows
      clipboard and sending it to a printer).</para>

    <para>For full control over a graph, follow this procedure:</para>

    <orderedlist>
      <listitem><para>Close the graph window.</para></listitem>
      <listitem><para>From the Session menu, choose <quote>Add last
	    graph</quote>.</para></listitem>
      <listitem><para>In the session icon window, right-click on the
	  new graph icon and choose either <quote>Edit using
	    GUI</quote> or <quote>Edit plot
	    commands</quote>.</para></listitem>
    </orderedlist>

    <para>The <quote>Edit using GUI</quote> item pops up a graphical
      controller for gnuplot which lets you fine-tune various aspects
      of the graph.  The <quote>Edit plot commands</quote> item opens
      an editor window containing the actual gnuplot command file for
      generating the graph: this gives you full control over graph
      details &mdash; if you know something about gnuplot. To find out
      more, see the gnuplot <ulink
	url="http://ricardo.ecn.wfu.edu/gnuplot.html">online
	manual</ulink> or <ulink
	url="http://www.gnuplot.org/">gnuplot.org</ulink>.</para>

    <para>See also the entry for <command>gnuplot</command> in 
      <xref linkend="cmdref"/> below &mdash; and the
      <command>graph</command> and <command>plot</command> commands
      for <quote>quick and dirty</quote> ASCII graphs.</para>
