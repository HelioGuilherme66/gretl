\chapter{Reserved Words}
\label{reswords}

Reserved words, which cannot be used as the names of variables, fall
into the following categories:

\begin{itemize}
\item Names of constants and data types, plus a few specials:
  \input tabinternals.tex
  
\item Names of \app{gretl} commands (see section~\ref{cmd-cmd}).
\end{itemize}

User-defined functions cannot have names which collide with built-in
functions, the names of which are shown in Table~\ref{tab:functions}.
