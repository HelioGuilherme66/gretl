\section{Basic native format}
\label{native}

In \app{gretl}'s native data format, a data set is represented by two
files.  One contains the actual data and the other information on how
the data should be read.  To be more specific:


\begin{enumerate}
\item \emph{Actual data}: A rectangular matrix of white-space
  separated numbers.  Each column represents a variable, each row an
  observation on each of the variables (spreadsheet style). Data
  columns can be separated by spaces or tabs. The filename should have
  the suffix \verb+.gdt+.  By default the data file is ASCII (plain
  text).  Optionally it can be gzip-compressed to save disk space. You
  can insert comments into a data file: if a line begins with the hash
  mark (\verb+#+) the entire line is ignored. This is consistent with
  gnuplot and octave data files.
\item \emph{Header}: The data file must be accompanied by a header
  file which has the same basename as the data file plus the suffix
  \verb+.hdr+.  This file contains, in order:

  \begin{itemize}
  \item (Optional) \emph{comments} on the data, set off by the opening
    string \verb+(*+ and the closing string \verb+*)+, each of these
    strings to occur on lines by themselves.
  \item (Required) list of white-space separated \emph{names of the
      variables} in the data file. Names are limited to 8 characters,
    must start with a letter, and are limited to alphanumeric
    characters plus the underscore.  The list may continue over more
    than one line; it is terminated with a semicolon, \verb+;+.
  \item (Required) \emph{observations} line of the form \verb+1 1 85+.
    The first element gives the data frequency (1 for undated or
    annual data, 4 for quarterly, 12 for monthly).  The second and
    third elements give the starting and ending observations.
    Generally these will be 1 and the number of observations
    respectively, for undated data.  For time-series data one can use
    dates of the form \cmd{1959.1} (quarterly, one digit after the
    point) or \cmd{1967.03} (monthly, two digits after the point). See
    [?] below for special use of this line in the case of panel data.


  \item The keyword \verb+BYOBS+.


  \end{itemize}


\end{enumerate}

Here is an example of a well-formed data header file.

	
\begin{code} 
  (* DATA9-6: Data on log(money), log(income) and interest rate from
  US.  Source: Stock and Watson (1993) Econometrica (unsmoothed data)
  Period is 1900-1989 (annual data).  Data compiled by Graham Elliott.
  *) lmoney lincome intrate ; 1 1900 1989 BYOBS
\end{code}



The corresponding data file contains three columns of data, each
having 90 entries.



\section{Extensions to the basic data format}
\label{extensions}


The options available in \app{gretl} data files are broader than the
setup just described, in three ways:
      


\begin{enumerate}
\item If the \verb+BYOBS+ keyword is replaced by \verb+BYVAR+, and
  followed by the keyword \verb+BINARY+, this indicates that the
  corresponding data file is in binary format.  Such data files can be
  written from \app{gretlcli} using the \cmd{store} command with the
  \cmd{-s} flag (single precision) or the \cmd{-o} flag (double
  precision).


\item If \verb+BYOBS+ is followed by the keyword \verb+MARKERS+,
  \app{gretl} expects a data file in which the \emph{first column}
  contains strings (8 characters maximum) used to identify the
  observations.  This may be handy in the case of cross-sectional data
  where the units of observation are identifiable: countries, states,
  cities or whatever.  It can also be useful for irregular time series
  data, such as daily stock price data where some days are not trading
  days --- in this case the observations can be marked with a date
  string such as \cmd{10/01/98}.  (Remember the 8-character maximum.)
  Note that \cmd{BINARY} and \cmd{MARKERS} are mutually exclusive
  flags. Also note that the ``markers'' are not considered to be a
  variable: this column does not have a corresponding entry in the
  list of variable names in the header file.


\item If a file with the same base name as the data file and header
  files, but with the suffix \verb+.lbl+, is found, this is read to
  fill out the descriptive labels for the data series. The format of
  the (plain text) label file is simple: each line contains the name
  of one variable (as found in the header file), followed by one or
  more spaces, followed by the descriptive label. Here is an example:

  \verb+price New car price index, 1982 base year+

  A label file of this sort is created automatically when you save
  data from \app{gretl}, if there is any descriptive information to be
  saved.  Such information can be added under the ``Variable, Edit
  label'' menu item.
	  


\end{enumerate}
