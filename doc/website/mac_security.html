<h1>gretl on macOS: Apple security isses</h1>
</center>

<p>
If you're downloading gretl from this site you can be confident that the
installer contains no malware. However, Apple's security measures may block
installing and/or running gretl. You shouldn't have a security problem with
installing a gretl <i>release</i> package, since these are both code-signed
and "notarized", but gretl snapshots are not notarized.
</p>

<p>
In any case, what you have to do depends on the version of macOS
you're running. If it's <b>older than Catalina</b> (10.15) then the
discussion (with screenshots) at the
<a href="http://rampagedev.wordpress.com/os-x-tweaks/app-cant-be-opened-because-it-was-not-downloaded-from-the-mac-app-store-fix-2/">rampagedev</a>
blog should tell you what you need to know. If it's <b>Catalina or
higher</b> then please read the following step-by-step guide.  The
name of the gretl package and the appearance of the dialogs on your
system may differ from what's shown below, but the general idea should
be the same.</p>

<ol type="1">
  <li><p>Open System Preferences and navigate to &quot;Security &amp;
  privacy&quot;. Select the General tab. We'll come back to this window shortly.</p></li>
  
  <li><p>Double-click the gretl .pkg file. You'll get a message "gretl-quartz.pkg can't be opened because Apple
    cannot check it ...". Click <b>OK</b> to close the window. (The
    file won't actually be called <kbd>gretl-quartz.pkg</kbd> any
    more, but the general idea remains the same.)</p></li>

  <li><p>In the tab mentioned in item 1 you will see a message with a button <b>Open Anyway</b>:
    click that button.</p></li>
  
  <img src="../images/open_anyway.png">

  <li><p>Double-click the gretl pkg file again. Now you'll get the same window as in item 2,
    but with two buttons: Open and Cancel. Click <b>Open</b> and gretl will be installed.</p></li>

</ol>

<p>
There's a further security issue with Catalina and higher: after
  installation of gretl, how do you allow the program to access files
  on your Desktop and other locations? Again, you do this via the
  &quot;Security &amp; privacy&quot; item under System Preferences;
  see <a href="https://support.apple.com/guide/mac-help/control-access-files-folders-mac-mchld5a35146/mac">Apple's
  access control page</a>.
