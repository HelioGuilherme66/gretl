<h1>gretl on macOS: Apple security isses</h1>
</center>

<p>
If you're downloading gretl from this site you can be confident that the
installer contains no malware. However, Apple's security measures may block
installing and/or running gretl. You shouldn't have a security problem with
installing a gretl <i>release</i> package, since these are both code-signed
and "notarized", but gretl snapshots are not notarized.
</p>

<p>
In any case, what you have to do depends on whether you're running macOS
10.15 ("Catalina") or higher, or an earlier version.
</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>If your macOS is <i>earlier than Catalina</i>, the discussion (with screenshots)
at the
<a href="http://rampagedev.wordpress.com/os-x-tweaks/app-cant-be-opened-because-it-was-not-downloaded-from-the-mac-app-store-fix-2/">rampagedev</a>
blog should tell you what you need to know.</p>
</li>

<li><p>If you're running <i>Catalina or higher</i>, here's a step-by-step HOWTO.</p>

<ol type="1">
  <li><p>Open System Preferences and navigate to &quot;Security &amp;
  privacy&quot;. Select the General tab. We'll come back to this window shortly.</p></li>
  
  <li><p>Double-click the gretl .pkg file. You'll get a message "gretl-quartz.pkg can't be opened because Apple
    cannot check it ...". Click <b>OK</b> to close the window. (The
    gretl package won't actually be called <kbd>gretl-quartz.pkg</kbd> any
    more, but the general idea remains the same.)</p></li>

  <li><p>In the tab mentioned in item 1 you will see a message with a button <b>Open Anyway</b>:
    click that button.</p></li>
  
  <img src="../images/osx-install-2.png">

  <li><p>Double-click the gretl pkg file again. Now you'll get the same window as in item 2,
    but with two buttons: Open and Cancel. Click <b>Open</b> and gretl will be installed.</p></li>

</ol>
</li>

<li><p>
  There's a further security issue with Catalina and higher:
  after installation of gretl, how do you allow the program to access
  files on your Desktop and other locations? Again, you do this via
  the &quot;Security &amp; privacy&quot; item under System
  Preferences;
  see <a href="https://support.apple.com/guide/mac-help/control-access-files-folders-mac-mchld5a35146/mac">Apple's
    access control page</a>.</p>
</li>
</ul>
