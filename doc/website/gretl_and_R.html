<p>
<b>gretl</b> (main page <a href="./index.html">here</a>) is designed as a
very user-friendly econometrics package.  While it is also reasonably 
sophisticated, it lacks some of the specialized statistical methods that
a working econometrician might desire.</p>

<p>As a way around this limitation, gretl offers an interface to the
comprehensive free-software statistical package, GNU R.  According to the
summary on the <a href="http://www.r-project.org/">R project website</a>,
"R is `GNU S' - A language and environment for statistical computing and
graphics. R is similar to the award-winning S system, which was developed
at Bell Laboratories by John Chambers et al." </p>

<p>Gretl has had for a long time the ability to save the current data
set in a format suitable for analysis using R, or to launch an R
session with the current gretl data set automatically loaded into R's
workspace. As of version 1.7.5, however, gretl's interaction with R
has become much more sophisticated: it is now possible to embed R
scripts within gretl scripts and have the two programs exchange data
and results in a relatively transparent way. For more details,
the <i>Gretl User's Guide</i>, which is supplied together with the
program but can also
be <a href="http://gretl.sourceforge.net/#man">downloaded</a>, has a
chapter devoted to this topic.</p>

<p>To find out more about GNU R, we recommend starting with <i>An
Introduction to R</i>, available <a
href="http://cran.r-project.org/doc/manuals/R-intro.pdf">here</a> as a PDF
file.  For further information, and to download R, visit <a
href="http://cran.r-project.org/">cran.r-project.org</a>.</p>
