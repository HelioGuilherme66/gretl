<p>
<b>gretl</b> (main page <a href="./index.html">here</a>) is designed as a
very user-friendly econometrics package.  While it is also reasonably 
sophisticated, it lacks some of the specialized statistical methods that
a working econometrician might desire.</p>

<p>As a way around this limitation, gretl offers an interface to the
comprehensive free-software statistical package, GNU R.  According to the
summary on the <a href="http://www.r-project.org/">R project website</a>,
"R is `GNU S' - A language and environment for statistical computing and
graphics. R is similar to the award-winning S system, which was developed
at Bell Laboratories by John Chambers et al." </p>

<p>From gretl, you can save the current data set in a format suitable for
analysis using R; you also have the option ("Start GNU R" under gretl's
Utilities menu) of launching an R session with the current gretl data set
automatically loaded into R's workspace.</p>

<p>To find out more about GNU R I recommend starting with <i>An
Introduction to R</i>, available <a
href="http://cran.r-project.org/doc/manuals/R-intro.pdf">here</a> as a PDF
file.  For further information, and to download R, visit <a
href="http://cran.r-project.org/">cran.r-project.org</a>.</p>
