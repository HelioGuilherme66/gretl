<p><b>Gretl</b> (main page <a href="./index.html">here</a>) is a free,
user-friendly and sophisticated econometrics package. Its coverage of
statistical methods is, however, not as comprehensive as that of
<a href="http://www.r-project.org/">GNU R</a>, which is also
free, open-source software.</p>

<p>To facilitate inter-operation of the two programs, gretl offers the
ability to save the current data set in a format suitable for analysis
using R; to launch an R session with the current gretl data set
automatically loaded into R's workspace; to embed R scripts within
gretl scripts; and, more generally, to have the two programs exchange
data and results in a fairly transparent way. The
<a href="http://gretl.sourceforge.net/#man">Gretl User's Guide</a>
has a chapter devoted to this topic.</p>

<p>To find out more about GNU R, we recommend starting with 
<a href="http://cran.r-project.org/doc/manuals/R-intro.pdf">An Introduction to R</a>.
