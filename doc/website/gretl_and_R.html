<p><b>Gretl</b> (main page <a href="./index.html">here</a>) is a free,
user-friendly and sophisticated econometrics package. Its coverage of
statistical methods is, however, not as comprehensive as that of
<a href="http://www.r-project.org/">GNU R</a>, which is also
free, open-source software.</p>

<p>To facilitate inter-operation of the two programs, gretl offers the
ability to save the current data set in a format suitable for analysis
using R; to launch an R session with the current gretl data set
automatically loaded into R's workspace; to embed R scripts within
gretl scripts; and, more generally, to have the two programs exchange
data and results in a fairly transparent way. The
<a href="http://gretl.sourceforge.net/#man">Gretl User's Guide</a>
has a chapter devoted to this topic.</p>

<p>To find out more about GNU R, we recommend starting with 
<a href="http://cran.r-project.org/doc/manuals/R-intro.pdf">An Introduction to R</a>. 
For further information, and to download R,
visit <a href="http://cran.r-project.org/">cran.r-project.org</a>.</p>

<p>The most efficient interaction with R is achieved by gretl calling
  into the R shared library (<kbd>libR.so</kbd> on
  Linux, <kbd>libR.dylib</kbd> on macOS, or <kbd>R.dll</kbd> on MS
  Windows).  This requires that the R library knows where its
  &ldquo;home&rdquo; is. The details of ensuring this point vary by
  platform, as follows.</p>

<h2>MS Windows</h2>

<p>By default, the R installer writes the required information into
  the Windows Registry. It's possible to customize the install such
  that no registry entry is created: <i>don't do that if you want to
  use R with gretl</i>.
</p>

<h2>Linux or similar</h2>

<p><kbd>R_HOME</kbd> should be defined in the environment.  This
  should be the parent directory of <kbd>lib/libR.so</kbd>. For
  example, if
  <kbd>/usr/lib/R/lib/libR.so</kbd> exists, <kbd>/usr/lib/R</kbd>
  is the correct value for <kbd>R_HOME</kbd>.
</p>

<h2>macOS</h2>

<p>Given a standard installation of R, nothing special should be
  needed. In a non-standard case you should define <kbd>R_HOME</kbd>
  to point to the parent directory of <kbd>lib/libR.dylib</kbd>,
  similar to the Linux case.
</p>

<h2>Alternative method</h2>

<p>An alternative is to specify the path to the shared library itself,
  under /Tools/Preferences/General/Programs in gretl. The relevant
  entry is &ldquo;Path to R library&rdquo;. If that setting is correct
  gretl can take care of putting a suitable value
  for <kbd>R_HOME</kbd> into the environment. On Windows, however,
  this setting will require updating whenever a new version of R is
  installed, so relying on the Registry is preferred.
