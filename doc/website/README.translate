Hello translators!

Please note: if you are contributing translations of the gretl
web pages, you should be aware that the pages that reference 
the current gretl version-number and the last release date are
auto-generated, based on "pattern" files in which the version
and date are represented by standard place-holders. These files
are located in the "template" sub-directory.

Here is a little table showing which of these pages are generated
from which original sources, with Turkish given as the example of 
translation. The files for other languages are named on the same
pattern as Turkish.

                 English               Turkish

Main page     index_pat.html     gretl_turkish_pat.html
Windows page  win32_pat.html     win32_pat_tr.html
OS X page     osx_pat.html       osx_pat_tr.html

Also please note: translating the gretl web pages is not a one-time
job! Translations will be useful only if they are updated fairly
regularly in step with changes in the English-language pages, which
can be tracked in git.
