<h1>Running gretl over a network</h1>
</center>

<p>In some settings it may be necessary or desirable to have users run
gretl over a network.  For example, the gretl executable resides on a
server in a computer lab, and users access the program from PCs that
do not themselves have gretl installed.</p>

<p>In this context the usual mechanism whereby the Windows version of
gretl gets its configuration information, namely reading from the
Windows registry on the local machine, will not work.  Since gretl is
not installed on the local machine, no relevant registry entries will
be found (and the default values will be inappropriate).</p>

<p>To meet this situation, gretl (version 1.2.1 or higher) offers a
special configuration option: If a plain text configuration file named
<b>gretlnet.txt</b> is found in the same directory as the gretl
executable, <b>gretlw32.exe</b>, this file will be read in preference to
the local registry.  Configuration options found in <b>gretlnet.txt</b>
will override the local registry, and will appear as fixed from the user's
point of view (the corresponding items in the gretl preferences dialog
will show as "grayed out" or insensitive).  For this to work (i.e. for
gretl to find the special config file), gretl must be invoked on the
client machine using the full path to the installed binary, e.g.
<kbd>L:\userdata\gretl\gretlw32.exe</kbd>.  </p>

<p>A network administrator using this facility should consider which
of gretl's options need to be set centrally, and which can be left up
to the local user.  If an option should be up to the user, it should
<i>not</i> be set in <b>gretlnet.txt</b>.  Typically, one might expect
that path settings should be made centrally, while boolean options may
be left to the user.  (Note that unlike paths, the boolean options
will be given appropriate default values even if no gretl entries can
be read from the local registry on start-up of the program.)</p>

<p>There follows an annotated example of <b>gretlnet.txt</b>.  The format of
this plain text file should be self-explanatory.  Lines beginning with a hash
mark (<kbd>#</kbd>) are comments.  Actual configuration lines take the form
<kbd>key = value</kbd> (the single spaces around the equals sign are
mandatory).  The example below is based on these assumptions:</p>

<ul>
  <li><p class="in-list">gretl is installed on a server that is mapped as drive
  <kbd>K</kbd> from the point of view of the client PCs.</p>
  <li><p class="in-list">The (primary) hard drive on the client machines is drive
  <kbd>C</kbd>.</p>
  <li><p class="in-list">When gretl was installed on the server, the installation
  path <kbd>c:\gretl</kbd> was used.</p>
  <li><p class="in-list">Users of the client PCs have write access to a
  directory named <kbd>c:\userdata</kbd> on the local machine.</p>
 </ul>

<p>You can edit this file in any text editor (e.g. Windows notepad).
If your setup differs in respect of the drive letter for the network
installation, replace <kbd>K:</kbd> throughout.  If gretl was
installed in (say) <kbd>c:\Program Files\gretl</kbd> on the server, then
replace <kbd>K:\gretl</kbd> with <kbd>K:\Program Files\gretl</kbd>
throughout. (Items with embedded spaces, e.g. "Progam Files", should be
handled correctly as is, do not wrap them in quotes.)
  You can grab a copy of the example with DOS-style
  line-termination here: <a href="./gretlnet.txt">gretlnet.txt</a>.</p>
