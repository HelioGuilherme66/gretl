<h2>Download</h2>

<p>gretl for Windows comes in the form of a self-extracting executable,
<a
href="http://prdownloads.sourceforge.net/gretl/gretl_install.exe">gretl_install.exe</a>
(Feb  2, 2004, about 7MB). Just download and run this: you will be
prompted for the location to install the program (the default is
<kbd>c:\userdata\gretl</kbd>).  The program has been tested on Windows 98 and
Windows XP; so far as I know it should work OK on all versions of
Windows higher than Windows 95.</p>

<p>Optional extras you may wish to install:</p>

<p>The above are all self-extracting installers.  You must install gretl before installing
the extra items.</p>


<p>The gretl manual is available separately as a PDF file: <a
href="../manual.pdf">manual.pdf</a>.  That's formatted for US letter
paper; there's also an A4 version: <a
href="../manual-a4.pdf">manual-a4.pdf</a>.  If you don't have the
software to read PDF files you can download it for free from <a
href="http://www.adobe.com/products/acrobat/readstep2.html">the Adobe
website</a>.</p>

<p>The executables were cross-compiled under GNU/Linux using <a
href="http://www.mingw.org/">mingw32</a> and Tor Lillqvist's <a
href="http://www.gimp.org/~tml/gimp/win32/downloads.html">gtk for
win32</a>. The free installer program is courtesy of <a
href="http://www.jrsoftware.org/">Jordan Russell</a>.</p>

<h2>Updating gretl</h2>

<p>When updating an existing installation of gretl, it's probably not
a bad idea to first run the uninstaller program
<kbd>unins000.exe</kbd>, which you should find in the main gretl
folder.  This will ensure that you don't get odd behavior due to
"stale" DLLs or Windows registry settings.  Note that running the
uninstaller will not touch any files you have created in the
<kbd>gretl/user</kbd> folder, but it will erase any customizations
you have made using the Preferences menu so you'll have to
re-establish these when you start the new version of the program.</p>

<h2>Running gretl over a network</h2>

<p>There's a page of advice <a href="./gretl_network.html">here</a> 
for anyone wanting to configure gretl for Windows to be run over a network, 
as in a computer lab setting.</p>

<h2>Building gretl for Windows</h2>

<p>If you want to build gretl for Windows yourself, download the gretl
source package (go <a
href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/gretl/">here</a> to find the
latest one) and take a look in the <kbd>win32</kbd> sub-directory.
You will find there a Makefile for the Windows version: it is actually
designed for cross-compiling gretl on Linux but it shouldn't be too
hard to modify it for building on Windows, particularly if you're
using the mingw32 compiler.</p>
