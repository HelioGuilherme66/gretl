<h1>Gretl: Gnu Regression, Econometrics and Time-series Library</h1>
<h2>for macOS</h2>
</center>

<p>
 This page offers gretl for macOS 10.6 ("Snow Leopard", released 2009) or
 higher. If you're running a version of OS X prior to 10.6 please see our 
 <a href="mac-legacy.html">gretl for legacy Macs</a> page.
</p>

<h2>Getting gretl</h2> 

<p>You have a choice of the latest "official" release or the current
"snapshot".  The snapshot is more up to date: often it will contain
bug-fixes but sometimes it will contain newly introduced bugs. To see
what's new in the snapshot, take a look at the gretl
<a href="../ChangeLog.html">Change log</a> (the "in progress" entry).</p>

<table cellpadding="2">

<p><b>Tip</b>: If you're updating your gretl installation it may
  be advisable to delete the old version of gretl before
  installing the new one.</p>

<h2>Installing gretl</h2>

<p>Here's the drill:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>
Click to download either the latest release or the "snapshot" (above).  The
selected gretl package file should appear in your Downloads after a short
while, or it may be opened by the Mac Installer program right away.
If the package is not opened automatically, minimize your browser window so
you can see what's happening on your desktop, then double-click on the gretl
file in Downloads to open the installer. Either way, you should then be
walked through the installation process.
</p></li>

<li><p>
Navigate to Applications in the Finder and you should now see a gretl
icon there. Double-clicking should start gretl. On its first run gretl
may take a while to start, as it scans the fonts available on your
system. Assuming gretl starts OK, you can drag its icon from Applications
onto the dock to get a quick-launcher.
</p></li>

<li><p>
Clean up: the installer (<kbd>pkg</kbd>) file can
be moved to the Trash once installation is completed.</p></li>
</ol>

<h2>Apple security issues</h2>

<p>If you're downloading gretl from this site you can be confident that the
installer contains no malware. However, Apple's security measures may block
installing and/or running gretl. In that case what you have to do depends on
whether you're running macOS 10.15 ("Catalina") or higher, or an earlier version.
</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>If your macOS is <i>earlier than Catalina</i>, the discussion (with screenshots)
at the
<a href="http://rampagedev.wordpress.com/os-x-tweaks/app-cant-be-opened-because-it-was-not-downloaded-from-the-mac-app-store-fix-2/">rampagedev</a>
blog should tell you what you need to know.</p>
</li>

<li><p>If you're running <i>Catalina or higher</i>, here's a step-by-step HOWTO.</p>

<ol type="1">
  <li><p>Open System Preferences and navigate to &quot;Security &amp;
  privacy&quot;. Select the General tab. We'll come back to this window shortly.</p></li>
  
  <li><p>Double-click the gretl .pkg file. You'll get a message "gretl-quartz.pkg can't be opened because Apple
    cannot check it ...". Click <b>OK</b> to close the window.</p></li>

  <img src="../images/osx-install-1.png">

  <li><p>In the tab mentioned in item 1 you will see a message with a button <b>Open Anyway</b>:
    click that button.</p></li>
  
  <img src="../images/osx-install-2.png">

  <li><p>Double-click the gretl pkg file again. Now you'll get the same window as in item 2,
    but with two buttons: Open and Cancel. Click <b>Open</b> and gretl will be installed.</p></li>

<h2><a name="optextra">Optional extras</a></h2>

<p>You may wish to install X-13-ARIMA-SEATS and/or TRAMO/SEATS. These are specialized programs for
analysis of seasonal time series data, in versions compatible with gretl. But
<i>please note</i>: the TRAMO/SEATS package below contains a 32-bit program
which will not run on macOS Catalina or higher. We will provide a 64-bit
version of TRAMO/SEATS if and when we can.
