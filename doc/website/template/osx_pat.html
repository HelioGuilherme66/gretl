<h1>Installing gretl on Mac OS X</h1>
</center>

<p>Gretl's graphical interface uses the GTK libraries.  To run gretl on
Mac OS X it is necessary to have the GTK libraries available.  There
are a couple of projects underway which aim to provide a "native" OS X
implementation of GTK, but neither is yet at a stage that is suitable
for production work.  At present the only way to run gretl on OS X is
to use an X11 ("X Window system") version of GTK.</p>

<h2>Basic prerequisites</h2>

<p>My own experience with building gretl for OS X is based on the following
setup:</p>

<ol>

<li><p class="in-list">OS X "Jaguar" version 10.2.4.
   See <a href="http://www.apple.com/macosx/">http://www.apple.com/macosx/</a>.</p></li>
<li><p class="in-list">The Apple/XFree86 X11 implementation for the
   Mac ("beta3"), which is or was available from 
   <a
  href="http://www.apple.com/macosx/x11/download/">http://www.apple.com/macosx/x11/download/</a>
   (SDK files as well as the runtime ones).</p></li>
<li><p class="in-list">Fink, which provides basic unix and package
   management functionality that is not provided by OS X or the Apple
   X11 distribution.  It is available from
   <a
  href="http://fink.sourceforge.net/download/">http://fink.sourceforge.net/download/</a>.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>With the release of OS X 10.3 "Panther", my information has become a little
dated.  I don't have Panther to experiment on, so if you successfully build gretl on
Panther please let me know if there are significant differences.  If anyone is
willing to give me a temporary login, via ssh, to a machine running Panther, I'll
to happy to do a test build and update these notes accordingly.</p>

<h2>Required fink packages</h2>
  
<p>Besides the basic installation of Fink itself, for building and
running gretl you will need to ensure that the following Fink packages
are present and correct (some of them may already be installed and up
to date, in which case Fink will tell you that).  After each package,
I show the command (to be typed at the command prompt in an xterm or
the Mac Terminal app) to do the job:</p>

<table cellspacing=8>
  <tr>
    <td>system-xfree86</td><td><kbd>fink install system-xfree86</kbd></td>
    </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>gtk</td><td><kbd>fink install gtk+2</kbd></td>
    </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>libxml2</td><td><kbd>fink install libxml2</kbd></td>
    </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>dlcompat</td><td><kbd>fink install dlcompat</kbd></td>
    </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>dlcompat-dev</td><td><kbd>fink install dlcompat-dev</kbd></td>
    </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>gnuplot</td><td><kbd>fink install gnuplot</kbd></td>
    </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>recode</td><td><kbd>fink install recode</kbd></td>
    </tr>
</table>

<p>In particular, you should ensure that gnuplot is up to date (the
package number must be at least 3.8i.0-2 to work with gretl).</p>

<h2>Environment variables</h2>

<p>To compile gretl using fink, you need to make sure the
<i>environment</i> is set up correctly -- before running gretl's
configure script.  This means setting several environment variables;
exactly how this is done depends on whether your shell is
tcsh or bash (tcsh was the default in OS X prior to Panther,
but I believe bash is the default under Panther).  You can
either execute the following commands one by one, or 
(better) put them into your shell startup file,
either <kbd>.tcshrc</kbd> or <kbd>.bashrc</kbd> (I think) in your 
home directory.</p>

<p>tcsh version:</p>

<pre>
setenv CFLAGS -I/sw/include
setenv LDFLAGS -L/sw/lib
setenv CXXFLAGS $CFLAGS
setenv CPPFLAGS $CXXFLAGS
setenv ACLOCAL_FLAGS "-I/sw/share/aclocal"
setenv PKG_CONFIG_PATH "/sw/lib/pkgconfig"
</pre>

<p>bash version:</p>

<pre>
export CFLAGS=-I/sw/include
export LDFLAGS=-L/sw/lib
export CXXFLAGS=$CFLAGS
export CPPFLAGS=$CXXFLAGS
export ACLOCAL_FLAGS="-I/sw/share/aclocal"
export PKG_CONFIG_PATH="/sw/lib/pkgconfig"
</pre>

<p>You should also make sure to source the <kbd>init.sh</kbd> supplied
by fink:</p>

<pre>
source /sw/bin/init.sh
</pre>

<p>You may want to look at the
<a href="http://fink.sourceforge.net/faq/usage-general.php">fink FAQ</a>.</p>

<h2>Configure and build</h2>

<p>Once you have the right versions of OS X, Apple's X11, Fink, and the
required Fink packages, and you have the environment correctly
configured, installing gretl should be fairly
straightforward.  I hope to make a Fink package for gretl available
before too long, but for now you have to install it from source.  Here
is how it goes:</p>

<ol>
<li><p class-"in-list">Download the source package:<br>

   <kbd>curl ftp://ricardo.ecn.wfu.edu/pub/gretl/gretl-VERSION.tar.bz2</kbd>
    </p></li>

<li><p class-"in-list">Unpack the source:<br>

   <kbd>tar xvfj gretl-VERSION.tar.bz2</kbd>
    </p></li>

<li><p class-"in-list">Move into the gretl source directory:<br> 

   <kbd>cd gretl-VERSION</kbd></p></li>

<li><p class-"in-list">Configure the source code package:<br>

   <kbd>./configure --prefix=/sw --disable-png-comments</kbd></p></li>

<li><p class-"in-list">Type <kbd>make</kbd> to build gretl.  This takes a while.</p></li>

<li><p class-"in-list">Type <kbd>sudo make install</kbd> to install gretl.</p></li>
</ol>
  

<p>You should now be able to run gretl by typing "gretl" at the command
prompt in an xterm (launched by starting up Apple's X11).</p>

<h2>Provisional gretl info file for Fink</h2>

<p>gretl-VERSION-1.info:</p>

<pre>
Package: gretl
Version: VERSION
Revision: 1
Maintainer: Allin Cottrell <cottrell@wfu.edu>
Description: GNU Econometrics package
Homepage: http://gretl.sourceforge.net/
DescDetail: <<
gretl is an econometrics package. It comprises a shared library,
a command-line client and a gui client that uses GTK.  gretl offers
several least-squares based estimators.  Besides reading data files
in its own format it also reads RATS 4 databases.  It has a built-in
spreadsheet for editing data, and uses gnuplot for graphing.  It can
output regression results in LaTeX format.
