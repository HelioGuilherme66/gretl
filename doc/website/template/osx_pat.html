<h1>Gretl: Gnu Regression, Econometrics and Time-series Library</h1>
<h2>for macOS</h2>
</center>

<p>
 This page offers gretl for macOS 10.9 ("Mavericks", released 2013) or
 higher. If you're running OS X 10.6, 10.7 or 10.8
 ("Snow Leopard", "Lion" or "Mountain Lion") we suggest trying
 the <a href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/gretl/files/gretl/2021a/gretl-2021a-quartz.pkg/download">2021a
 release</a> of gretl.  If you're running OS X 10.5 or earlier please
 see our
 <a href="mac-legacy.html">gretl for legacy Macs</a> page.</p>

<p>Alternative download: if you
 use <a href="https://www.macports.org/">MacPorts</a> (or want to try
 it), builds of gretl are available for all Mac architectures
 at <a href="https://ports.macports.org/port/gretl/">macports.org</a>.
 These builds are not made by the gretl team and don't include some
 "extras" supplied with our own builds, but they're done very
 professionally.
</p>

<p>Here you have a choice of the latest official release or the current
"snapshot".  The snapshot is more up to date: often it will contain
bug-fixes but sometimes it will contain newly introduced bugs. To see
what's new in the snapshot, take a look at the gretl
<a href="../ChangeLog.html">Change log</a> (the "in progress"
entry).</p>

<p><b>Tip</b>: If you're updating your gretl installation it may
  be advisable to delete the old version of gretl before
  installing the new one.</p>

<h2>Installing gretl</h2>

<ol>
<li><p>
Click to download either the latest release or the snapshot (above).  The
selected gretl package file should appear in your Downloads after a short
while, or it may be opened by the Installer program right away.
If the package is not opened automatically, minimize your browser window so
you can see what's happening on your desktop, then double-click on the gretl
file in Downloads to open the installer. Either way, you should then be
walked through the installation process. If Apple's security system <b>stops
you from opening a gretl package</b>, please
look <a href="./mac_security.html">here</a> for guidance on what to do.
</p></li>

<li><p>After installing gretl, navigate to Applications in the Finder and
you should see a gretl icon there. Double-clicking should start
gretl. Assuming gretl starts OK, you can drag its icon from Applications
onto the dock to get a quick-launcher.
</p></li>

<li><p>Clean up: the installer (<kbd>pkg</kbd>) file can be moved to the
Trash once installation is completed.
</p></li>

<li><p>
Access to files: on recent macOS you might see messages about gretl not
having permission to access files in your home folder. If so, the fix is
explained at
<a href="https://support.apple.com/guide/mac-help/control-access-files-folders-mac-mchld5a35146/mac">Apple's
  access control page</a>.
</p></li>
</ol>
