<h1>Gretl: Gnu Regression, Econometrics and Time-series Library</h1>
<h2>for macOS</h2>
</center>

<p>
 This page offers gretl for macOS 10.9 ("Mavericks", released 2013) or
 higher. If you're running OS X 10.6, 10.7 or 10.8
 ("Snow Leopard", "Lion" or "Mountain Lion") we suggest trying
 the <a href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/gretl/files/gretl/2021a/gretl-2021a-quartz.pkg/download">2021a
 release</a> of gretl.  If you're running OS X 10.5 of earlier please
 see our
 <a href="mac-legacy.html">gretl for legacy Macs</a> page. Or if you
 use <a href="https://www.macports.org/">MacPorts</a> (or want to try
 it), builds of gretl are available for all Mac architectures
 at <a href="https://ports.macports.org/port/gretl/">macports.org</a>.
 The MacPorts builds are not made by the gretl team and don't include
 some "extras" supplied with our own builds, but they're done
 very professionally.
</p>

<p>Here you have a choice of the latest official release or the current
"snapshot".  The snapshot is more up to date: often it will contain
bug-fixes but sometimes it will contain newly introduced bugs. To see
what's new in the snapshot, take a look at the gretl
<a href="../ChangeLog.html">Change log</a> (the "in progress"
entry).</p>

<p><b>Tip</b>: If you're updating your gretl installation it may
  be advisable to delete the old version of gretl before
  installing the new one.</p>

<h2>Installing gretl</h2>

<p>Here's the drill:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>
Click to download either the latest release or the snapshot (above).  The
selected gretl package file should appear in your Downloads after a short
while, or it may be opened by the Mac Installer program right away.
If the package is not opened automatically, minimize your browser window so
you can see what's happening on your desktop, then double-click on the gretl
file in Downloads to open the installer. Either way, you should then be
walked through the installation process.
</p></li>

<li><p> Navigate to Applications in the Finder and you should now see
a gretl icon there. Double-clicking should start gretl. Assuming gretl
starts OK, you can drag its icon from Applications onto the dock to
get a quick-launcher.
</p></li>

<li><p> Clean up: the installer (<kbd>pkg</kbd>) file can be moved to
the Trash once installation is completed.</p></li>
</ol>

<h2>Apple security issues</h2>

<p>If you're downloading gretl from this site you can be confident that the
installer contains no malware. However, Apple's security measures may block
installing and/or running gretl. In that case what you have to do depends on
whether you're running macOS 10.15 ("Catalina") or higher, or an earlier version.
</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>If your macOS is <i>earlier than Catalina</i>, the discussion (with screenshots)
at the
<a href="http://rampagedev.wordpress.com/os-x-tweaks/app-cant-be-opened-because-it-was-not-downloaded-from-the-mac-app-store-fix-2/">rampagedev</a>
blog should tell you what you need to know.</p>
</li>

<li><p>If you're running <i>Catalina or higher</i>, here's a step-by-step HOWTO.</p>

<ol type="1">
  <li><p>Open System Preferences and navigate to &quot;Security &amp;
  privacy&quot;. Select the General tab. We'll come back to this window shortly.</p></li>
  
  <li><p>Double-click the gretl .pkg file. You'll get a message "gretl-quartz.pkg can't be opened because Apple
    cannot check it ...". Click <b>OK</b> to close the window.</p></li>

  <img src="../images/osx-install-1.png">

  <li><p>In the tab mentioned in item 1 you will see a message with a button <b>Open Anyway</b>:
    click that button.</p></li>
  
  <img src="../images/osx-install-2.png">

  <li><p>Double-click the gretl pkg file again. Now you'll get the same window as in item 2,
    but with two buttons: Open and Cancel. Click <b>Open</b> and gretl will be installed.</p></li>

  <img src="../images/osx-install-3.png">
</ol>
</li>

<li><p>There's a further security issue with Catalina and higher:
  after installation of gretl, how do you allow the program to access
  files on your Desktop and other locations? Again, you do this via
  the &quot;Security &amp; privacy&quot; item under System
  Preferences;
  see <a href="https://support.apple.com/guide/mac-help/control-access-files-folders-mac-mchld5a35146/mac">Apple's
    Catalina guide</a>.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<h2><a name="optextra">Optional extras</a></h2>

<p>You may wish to install X-13-ARIMA-SEATS and/or TRAMO/SEATS. These are specialized programs for
analysis of seasonal time series data, in 64-bit macOS versions compatible with gretl. They
can be installed via the "gretl console" in the GUI program; just type the
following commands, respectively:</p>
<pre>
  pkg install x13as-mac64.tar.gz
  pkg install tramo-seats-mac64.tar.gz
</pre>
<p>At present these addons are Intel-only. On Macs with M1 (Apple
  Silicon) processor you will need Apple's "Rosetta 2" translator to
  run them. This can be installed via the command line in a Terminal
  window:
</p>
<pre>
  /usr/sbin/softwareupdate --install-rosetta --agree-to-license
</pre>
