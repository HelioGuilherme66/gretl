<h2>Getting gretl</h2> 

<p>You have a choice of the latest "official" release or the current
"snapshot".  The snapshot is more up to date: often it will contain
bug-fixes but sometimes it will contain newly introduced bugs. To see
what's new in the snapshot, take a look at the gretl
<a href="../ChangeLog.html">Change log</a> (the "in progress" entry).</p>

<p><b>Tip</b>: If you're updating your gretl installation it's
  probably a good idea to delete the old version of gretl before
  installing the new one.</p>

<h2>Installing gretl</h2> 

<p>
1. Click to download either the latest release or the "snapshot".  The
selected gretl file should appear in your Downloads after a short
while.  Once the download is complete, minimize your browser window so
you can see what's happening on your own computer.
</p>

<p>
2. Double-click on the gretl file in Downloads to open the gretl "disk
image".  If you don't see a gretl disk-image window after
double-clicking, open the Finder and look at the foot of the left-hand
pane. The names of any currently available disk images should be shown
there. Double click on "gretl" to make it appear.
</p>

<p>
3. Once you've got the gretl disk-image window in view, you should see a
gretl icon and a folder labeled "Applications". Drag the gretl icon
onto Applications to install the program.
</p>

<p>
4. Navigate to Applications in the Finder and you should now see a gretl
icon there. Double-clicking should start gretl. On its first run gretl
may take a while to start, as it scans the fonts available on your
system. If gretl starts OK, you can drag its icon from Applications
onto the dock to get a quick-launcher.
</p>

<p>5. Finally, clean up. Open the finder and go to the bottom of the
left-hand pane. If you see an item there for gretl, use the little
up-arrow button to eject it. Then go to your Downloads: you can move
the original gretl <kbd>dmg</kbd> file to the trash.</p>

<p><b>Note on Mavericks</b>: If you're trying to install on OS X
  Mavericks you may find that the OS rejects the installation, or
  won't let the program run, on the grounds that gretl "was not
  downloaded from the Mac App Store". This is not hard to
  fix. There's a good discussion with
  screenshots <a href="http://rampagedev.wordpress.com/os-x-tweaks/app-cant-be-opened-because-it-was-not-downloaded-from-the-mac-app-store-fix-2/">here</a>,
  but just in case that link goes bad here's the short version:</p>

<p>1. Open System Preferences.</p>

<p>2. Under the Personal tab, select the item named "Security &amp;
    Privacy".</p>

<p>3. Go to the General tab and unlock the menu (the little padlock
    marked "Click the lock to make changes").</p>

<p>4.Under the section "Allow applications downloaded from"
    select <b>Anywhere</b>.</p>

<h2>Trouble?</h2>

<p>The gretl disk image is documented in 
<a href="./README-quartz.pdf">README-quartz.pdf</a>, which contains some suggestions for 
trouble-shooting.  Briefly, if you want to debug a non-functioning
gretl on OS X, please try this: open a Terminal window and run the following
commands (change the first line if you installed gretl somewhere other than 
<kbd>/Applications</kbd>):

<pre>
cd /Applications/Gretl.app/Contents/MacOS
./gretl.sh
</pre>

<p>This should give you some feedback on what is going wrong.</p>

<h2>Optional extras</h2>

<p>You may wish to install X-13-ARIMA-SEATS and/or TRAMO/SEATS. These are specialized programs for
analysis of seasonal time series data, in versions compatible with gretl.
