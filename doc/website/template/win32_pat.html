<h1>Gretl: Gnu Regression, Econometrics and Time-series Library</h1>
<h2>for Microsoft Windows</h2>
</center>

<h2>System requirements</h2>

<p>Please note that as of version 1.9.4, 
gretl requires Windows XP or higher
and a processor that supports the SSE2 instruction set. SSE2 support
is found in all modern processors; it is absent in AMD CPUs prior to
the Athlon 64, and in Intel CPUs prior to the Pentium 4.
For versions of gretl that will run on older systems, 
<a href="#old-windows">see below</a>.</p>

<h2>You have some administrative rights on your Windows system</h2>

<p>
That means you're a "power-user" or better. In that case you'll probably 
want to use the self-extracting executable,
<a
href="http://prdownloads.sourceforge.net/gretl/gretl-VERSION.exe">gretl-VERSION.exe</a>
(SHORTDATE, about 13MB). Just download and run this: you will be
prompted for the location to install the program (the default is
<kbd>c:\Program Files\gretl</kbd>).</p>

<p>The link above is to the latest official release.  Another possibilility
is to download the current "snapshot" of gretl:
<a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/gretl/files/snapshots/gretl_install.exe/download">gretl_install.exe</a>.
This will be more up to date: often it will contain 
bug-fixes but sometimes it will contain newly introduced bugs. 
Translations into languages other than English are likely to be
incomplete.  What's new in the snapshot?  Take a look at the 
<a href="../ChangeLog.html">Change log</a> (the "in progress" entry).</p>

<h2>You have no administrative rights on Windows</h2>

<p>Then you can't use the self-installer. But you can install gretl from a zip
archive: either the latest release,
<a href="http://prdownloads.sourceforge.net/gretl/gretl-VERSION-win32.zip">gretl-VERSION-win32.zip</a>
or the current snapshot,
<a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/gretl/files/snapshots/gretl-win32.zip/download">gretl-win32.zip</a>
Just unzip this in any location where you have write permission. <i>Please note</i>: you must perserve
the internal directory structure of the archive or the program will not work. In GUI unzipping programs
this option may be called "enable folders" or something like that. Also note that the whole archive
is in a directory called <kbd>gretl</kbd>. So, for example, if you unzip the archive into a directory
named <kbd>c:\userdata</kbd>, the gretl GUI program will be at
<kbd>c:\userdata\gretl\gretlw32.exe</kbd>.

<p>The above are all self-extracting installers.  You must install gretl before installing
the extra items.</p>

<p>The executables were cross-compiled under GNU/Linux using <a
href="http://www.mingw.org/">mingw32</a> and <a
href="http://www.gtk.org/download-windows.html">GTK for
Windows</a> (thanks Tor Lillqvist!). The free installer program is courtesy of <a
href="http://www.jrsoftware.org/">Jordan Russell</a>.</p>

<h2><a name="old-windows">gretl for older systems</a></h2>

<p>For older systems, 
<a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/gretl/files/gretl/1.9.3/gretl-1.9.3.exe/download">gretl 
1.9.3</a> runs on Windows 2000 (and does not require SSE2), and 
<a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/gretl/files/gretl/1.6.5/gretl-1.6.5.exe/download">gretl 
1.6.5</a> is the most recent version that will run on Windows 98.</p>

<h2>Support for multiple languages</h2>

<p>Besides English, gretl supports French, Italian, Spanish, German,
Basque, Portuguese, Polish, Turkish, Czech, Albanian, Russian and Traditional Chinese.  
Normally it shouldn't be necessary to do anything special to get gretl to appear in the 
local language: the program comes with the full set of translations, and they should 
be used automatically, based on the language setting of your computer.  In some
circumstances, however, it may be necessary to adjust your language
setting to achieve the expected effect.  This can be done
in the Windows control panel.</p>

<h2>Updating gretl</h2>

<p>When updating an existing installation of gretl, it's a good
idea to first run the uninstaller program
<kbd>unins000.exe</kbd>, which you should find in the main gretl
folder.  This will ensure that you don't get odd behavior due to
"stale" DLLs or Windows registry settings.  Note that running the
uninstaller will not touch any files you have created in the
<kbd>gretl/user</kbd> folder, but it will erase any customizations
you have made using the Preferences menu so you'll have to
re-establish these when you start the new version of the program.</p>

<h2>Running gretl over a network</h2>

<p>There's a page of advice <a href="./gretl_network.html">here</a> 
for anyone wanting to configure gretl for Windows to be run over a network, 
as in a computer lab setting.</p>

<h2>Building gretl for Windows</h2>

<p>If you want to build gretl for Windows yourself, download the gretl
source package (go <a
href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/gretl/">here</a> to find the
latest one) and take a look in the <kbd>win32</kbd> sub-directory.
You will find there a Makefile for the Windows version: it is actually
designed for cross-compiling gretl on Linux but it shouldn't be too
hard to modify it for building on Windows, particularly if you're
using the mingw32 compiler.</p>
