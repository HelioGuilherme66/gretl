<h1>Gretl: Gnu Regression, Econometrics and Time-series Library</h1>
<h2>MS Windows version</h2>
</center>

<h2>Download</h2>

<p>gretl for Windows comes in the form of a self-extracting executable,
<a
href="http://prdownloads.sourceforge.net/gretl/gretl-VERSION.exe">gretl-VERSION.exe</a>
(SHORTDATE, about 9MB). Just download and run this: you will be
prompted for the location to install the program (the default is
<kbd>c:\userdata\gretl</kbd>).  The program has been tested on Windows 98 and
Windows XP; so far as I know it should work OK on all versions of
Windows higher than Windows 95.</p>

<p>The link above is to the latest official release.  Another possibilility
is to download the current "snapshot" of gretl from Wake Forest University:
<a href="http://ricardo.ecn.wfu.edu/pub/gretl/gretl_install.exe">gretl_install.exe</a>.
This is likely to be somewhat more up to date: sometimes it will contain 
bug-fixes, and sometimes it will contain newly introduced bugs!  
Translations into languages other than English are likely to be
incomplete.</p>

<p>Optional extras you may wish to install:</p>

<p>The above are all self-extracting installers.  You must install gretl before installing
the extra items.</p>

<p>The executables were cross-compiled under GNU/Linux using <a
href="http://www.mingw.org/">mingw32</a> and Tor Lillqvist's <a
href="http://www.gimp.org/~tml/gimp/win32/downloads.html">gtk for
win32</a>. The free installer program is courtesy of <a
href="http://www.jrsoftware.org/">Jordan Russell</a>.</p>

<h2>Support for multiple languages</h2>

<p>Besides English, gretl supports French, Italian, Spanish, German
and Polish.  Normally it shouldn't be necessary to do anything special
to get gretl to appear in the local language: the program comes with
the full set of translations, and they should be used automatically,
based on the language setting of your computer.  In some
circumstances, however, it may be necessary to adjust your language
setting to achieve the expected effect.  Your language setting can be
adjusted in the Windows control panel.  If you can't get this to work,
here is a check you can perform:</p>

<ul>

<li>
<p>Open a Windows console (sometimes inaccurately called a "DOS
box").</p>
</li>

<li><p>Change directory (<kbd>cd</kbd>) to the directory where gretl
is installed.  For example, type</p>

<pre>
cd c:\userdata\gretl
</pre>

<p>and press the Enter key.<p>
</li>

<li>
<p>Type "<kbd>set LANG=</kbd>" followed by the two-letter code for your
language.  For example, if your language is Italian, type</p>

<pre>
set LANG=it
</pre>

<p>and press Enter.  (French is <kbd>fr</kbd>, Spanish is
<kbd>es</kbd>, Polish is <kbd>pl</kbd> and German is <kbd>de</kbd>.)
</p>
</li>  

<li><p>Then launch gretl from the console: type</p>

<pre>
gretlw32.exe
</pre>
<p>and press Enter.</p>
</li>

</ul>

<p>Gretl should appear in the selected language, if it is supported.
If you can get gretl to come up in the right language in this way, it
should be possible to achieve the same effect by making the correct
selection of language in the Windows control panel.</p>


<h2>Updating gretl</h2>

<p>When updating an existing installation of gretl, it's a good
idea to first run the uninstaller program
<kbd>unins000.exe</kbd>, which you should find in the main gretl
folder.  This will ensure that you don't get odd behavior due to
"stale" DLLs or Windows registry settings.  Note that running the
uninstaller will not touch any files you have created in the
<kbd>gretl/user</kbd> folder, but it will erase any customizations
you have made using the Preferences menu so you'll have to
re-establish these when you start the new version of the program.</p>

<h2>Running gretl over a network</h2>

<p>There's a page of advice <a href="./gretl_network.html">here</a> 
for anyone wanting to configure gretl for Windows to be run over a network, 
as in a computer lab setting.</p>

<h2>Building gretl for Windows</h2>

<p>If you want to build gretl for Windows yourself, download the gretl
source package (go <a
href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/gretl/">here</a> to find the
latest one) and take a look in the <kbd>win32</kbd> sub-directory.
You will find there a Makefile for the Windows version: it is actually
designed for cross-compiling gretl on Linux but it shouldn't be too
hard to modify it for building on Windows, particularly if you're
using the mingw32 compiler.</p>
