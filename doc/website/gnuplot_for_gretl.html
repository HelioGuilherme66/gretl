<h1>Gnuplot for gretl on Linux</h1>
</center>

<p>
Hopefully these instructions will become redundant before long, but 
if you're running gretl on Linux the version of
gnuplot available via your Linux distribution may not be sufficiently
up to date to work optimally with gretl.  For best results, we 
recommend the 5.0 release or higher, or current CVS.
</p>

<p>
To get an up-to-date build of gnuplot for use with gretl you can
build gnuplot from the CVS source yourself.
</p>

<h2>Build from source</h2>

<p>
Note that for this to succeed you will need to have the "devel" packages
for GTK+ and Xorg installed.
</p>

<pre>
 export CVSROOT=:pserver:anonymous@gnuplot.cvs.sourceforge.net:/cvsroot/gnuplot
 cvs login
 cvs -z3 checkout gnuplot
</pre>

<p>Just hit Enter when asked for a password.  Then</p>

<pre>
 sh ./prepare
 ./configure --prefix=/opt/gnuplot
 make
 sudo make install
</pre>

<p>The choice of installing to <kbd>/opt/gnuplot</kbd> is designed to
avoid collisions with gnuplot as installed by your Linux distro.</p>

<h2>Using the new gnuplot</h2>

<p>
In gretl, go to Tools/Preferences/General/Programs and change the
"gnuplot" entry to read
</p>

<pre>
 /opt/gnuplot/bin/gnuplot
</pre>

<p>Then re-start gretl.</p>
