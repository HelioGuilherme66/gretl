<h1>Gnuplot for gretl on Linux</h1>
</center>

<p>
Hopefully these instructions will become redundant before long, but right
now (December 2009) if you're running gretl on Linux the version of
gnuplot available via your Linux distribution is probably not sufficiently
up to date to work optimally with gretl.  For best results, gnuplot
should be version 4.4 or higher.
</p>

<p>
To get a good build of gnuplot for use with gretl you have two options:
build CVS gnuplot yourself, or use a special packaged binary.
</p>

<h2>Build from source</h2>

<p>
Note that for this to succeed you will need to have the "devel" packages
for GTK+ and Xorg installed.
</p>

<pre>
 export CVSROOT=:pserver:anonymous@gnuplot.cvs.sourceforge.net:/cvsroot/gnuplot
 cvs login
 cvs -z3 checkout gnuplot
</pre>

<p>Just hit Enter when asked for a password.  Then</p>

<pre>
 sh ./prepare
 ./configure --prefix=/opt/gnuplot
 make
 sudo make install
</pre>

<p>The choice of installing to <kbd>/opt/gnuplot</kbd> is designed to
avoid collisions with gnuplot as installed by your Linux distro.</p>

<h2>Packaged binary</h2>

<p>If you would prefer to try a pre-built binary, use the following
commands to download and install the package.</p>

<pre>
 cd /tmp
 wget http://ricardo.ecn.wfu.edu/pub/gretl/gnuplot-4.5-i586.tar.gz
 cd / 
 sudo tar xvfz /tmp/gnuplot-4.5-i586.tar.gz
 rm /tmp/gnuplot-4.5-i586.tar.gz
</pre>

<p>Note that this package installs into <kbd>/opt/gnuplot</kbd>.</p>

<h2>Using the new gnuplot</h2>

<p>
In gretl, go to Tools/Preferences/General/Programs and change the
"gnuplot" entry to read
</p>

<pre>
 /opt/gnuplot/bin/gnuplot
</pre>

<p>Then re-start gretl.</p>
