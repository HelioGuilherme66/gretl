<h1>Gnuplot for gretl on Linux</h1>
</center>

<p>
Hopefully these instructions will become redundant before long, but right
now (December 2009) if you're running gretl on Linux the version of
gnuplot available via your Linux distribution is probably not sufficiently
up to date to work optimally with gretl.  For best results, gnuplot
should be version 4.3 or higher, with a build date of at least mid-2009.
</p>

<p>
To get a good build of gnuplot for use with gretl you have two options:
build CVS gnuplot yourself, or use a special packaged binary.
</p>

<h2>Build from source</h2>

<pre>
 export CVSROOT=:pserver:anonymous@gnuplot.cvs.sourceforge.net:/cvsroot/gnuplot
 cvs login
 cvs -z3 checkout gnuplot
</pre>

<p>Just hit Enter when asked for a password.  Then</p>

<pre>
 sh ./prepare
 ./configure --prefix=/opt/gnuplot
 make
 sudo make install
</pre>

<p>The choice of installing to <kbd>/opt/gnuplot</kbd> is designed to
avoid collisions with gnuplot as installed by your Linux distro.</p>

<h2>Packaged binary</h2>

<pre>
 cd /tmp
 wget http:/ricardo.ecn.wfu.edu/pub/gretl/gnuplot-4.5-i586.tar.gz
 sudo cd / && tar xvfz /tmp/gnuplot-4.5-i586.tar.gz
 rm /tmp/gnuplot-4.5-i586.tar.gz
</pre>

<p>Note that this package installs into <kbd>/opt/gnuplot</kbd>.</p>

<p>
In gretl, go to Tools/Preferences/General/Programs and change the
"gnuplot" entry to read
</p>

<pre>
 /opt/gnuplot/bin/gnuplot
</pre>

<p>Then re-start gretl.</p>
