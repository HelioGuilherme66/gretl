<h1>gretl and TRAMO/SEATS</h1>
</center>

<p>TRAMO stands for "Time series Regression with ARIMA noise, Missing
values and Outliers" and SEATS for "Signal Extraction in ARIMA Time
Series".  These programs (which are commonly used together) were
developed by Victor Gómez and Agustín Maravall at the Bank of Spain.</p>

<p>The home page for these programs is at <a
href="http://www.bde.es/servicio/software/econome.htm">www.bde.es</a>.
To quote the description given there, "The programs are fundamentally
aimed at monthly or lower frequency time series. Although structured
to meet the needs of an expert analyst, they can be reliably used in
an entirely automatic manner. The main applications are forecasting,
seasonal adjustment, trend-cycle estimation, construction of composite
leading indicators, interpolation, detection and correction of
outliers, estimation of special effects, and quality control of data."</p>

<p>To install TRAMO/SEATS for use with gretl under
  <b>GNU/Linux</b> please use the binary rpm <a
href="http://ricardo.ecn.wfu.edu/pub/gretl/tramo-seats-98-1.i386.rpm">tramo-seats-98-1.i386.rpm</a>.
(Source code for the programs is not freely available, although the
authors were kind enough to give me access to the source to build this
version.)  </p>

<p>If you wish to use TRAMO/SEATS with gretl on <b>Windows</b>, you
should download the self-installer, <a
  href="http://ricardo.ecn.wfu.edu/pub/gretl/ts_install.exe">ts_install.exe</a>
  and run it.  You will be prompted for an installation directory, by
  default <kbd>c:\userdata\tramo</kbd>.  This package contains
  the programs <kbd>tramo.exe</kbd> and <kbd>seats.exe</kbd> in win32
console form, along with
  examples and documentation in PDF format.  I am grateful to Gianluca
Caporello for permission to redistribute tramo and seats in this
form.</p>

<p>Support for TRAMO/SEATS is new in version 1.0.3 of gretl and at
present it is quite limited, but if there is interest in this feature
I will probably aim to develop it further.  The following pictures
illustrate what you can do as of now.</p>

<p>After opening a suitable data set (i.e. containing seasonal time
series), select a variable in the gretl main window and pull down the
Variable menu.  Select "TRAMO analysis".</p>

<p>You will then see a dialog box which gives you the choice of saving
(into the current gretl data set) up to three of the series generated
by SEATS, namely the seasonally adjusted version of the input
series, the estimated trend/cycle component of the series, and the
estimated "irregular" component.  At this point you can also choose
whether or not to display a graph showing these series.</p>

<p>If you choose to display the graph, you should see something like
this:</p>

<p>Besides saving output series and displaying the graph, you will
also see the full output from the SEATS analysis.  An excerpt
from this is shown below.</p>
