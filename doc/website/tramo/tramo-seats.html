<h1>gretl and TRAMO/SEATS</h1>
</center>

<p>TRAMO stands for "Time series Regression with ARIMA noise, Missing
values and Outliers" and SEATS for "Signal Extraction in ARIMA Time
Series".  These programs (which are commonly used together) were
developed by Victor Gómez and Agustín Maravall at the Bank of Spain.</p>

<p>The home page for these programs is at <a
href="http://www.bde.es/servicio/software/econome.htm">www.bde.es</a>.
To quote the description given there, "The programs are fundamentally
aimed at monthly or lower frequency time series. Although structured
to meet the needs of an expert analyst, they can be reliably used in
an entirely automatic manner. The main applications are forecasting,
seasonal adjustment, trend-cycle estimation, construction of composite
leading indicators, interpolation, detection and correction of
outliers, estimation of special effects, and quality control of
  data."</p>

<p>Downloads of TRAMO/SEATS for use with gretl can be found in the
  <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/gretl/files/tramo/">tramo
    folder</a>. The file you want depends on your platform:</p>

<p>(Source code for these programs is not freely available, but the
authors were kind enough to give the gretl team access to the sources to build
these packages. We are grateful to Gianluca Caporello for permission to
redistribute tramo and seats in this form.)</p>

<p><b>Please note</b>: after installing TRAMO/SEATS it may be necessary to
  adjust gretl's expectation of where to find the programs. To do this,
  go to the "Tools" menu in the gretl main window and select
  "Preferences, General", then the "Programs" tab. Look for the item
  titled "Path to tramo".</p>

<p>After opening a suitable dataset (i.e. containing seasonal time
series), select a variable in the gretl main window and pull down the
Variable menu.  Select "TRAMO analysis".</p>

</center>

<p>You will then see a dialog box that gives you a choice between
  the "Standard automatic analysis" and some alternatives (which
  you can explore at your leisure).

<p>Clicking on the "Output" tab gives you some further choices,
  including saving output series and plotting the results of
  the analysis.</p>

<p>If you choose to display the graph, you should see something like
this:</p>

<p>Besides saving output series and displaying the graph, you will
also see the full output from the SEATS analysis.  An excerpt
from this is shown below.</p>
