<h1>gretl and TRAMO/SEATS</h1>
</center>

<p>TRAMO stands for "Time series Regression with ARIMA noise, Missing
values and Outliers" and SEATS for "Signal Extraction in ARIMA Time
Series".  These programs (which are commonly used together) were
developed by Victor Gómez and Agustín Maravall at the Bank of Spain.</p>

<p>This software does not seem to have a web presence any more, but to
  quote the description formerly given at the Bank of Spain/Banco de
  España site, "The programs are fundamentally aimed at monthly or
  lower frequency time series. Although structured to meet the needs
  of an expert analyst, they can be reliably used in an entirely
  automatic manner. The main applications are forecasting, seasonal
  adjustment, trend-cycle estimation, construction of composite
  leading indicators, interpolation, detection and correction of
  outliers, estimation of special effects, and quality control of
  data."</p>

<p>Downloads of TRAMO/SEATS for use with gretl can be found in the
  <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/gretl/files/tramo/">tramo
    folder</a>. The file you want depends on your platform; please
  see the descriptions you can find in that folder.</p>

<p>Source code for these programs is not freely available, but the
authors were kind enough to give the gretl team access to the sources
to build these packages. We are grateful to Gianluca Caporello for
permission to redistribute tramo and seats in this form.</p>

<p><b>Please note</b>: after installing TRAMO/SEATS it may be necessary to
  adjust gretl's expectation of where to find the programs. To do this,
  go to the "Tools" menu in the gretl main window and select
  "Preferences, General", then the "Programs" tab. Look for the item
  titled "Path to tramo".</p>

<p>After opening a suitable dataset (i.e. containing seasonal time
series), select a variable in the gretl main window and pull down the
Variable menu.  Select "TRAMO analysis".</p>

<p>You will then see a dialog box that gives you a choice between
  the "Standard automatic analysis" and some alternatives (which
  you can explore at your leisure).

<p>Clicking on the "Output" tab gives you some further choices,
  including saving output series and plotting the results of
  the analysis.</p>

<p>If you choose to display the graph, you should see something like
this:</p>

<p>Besides saving output series and displaying the graph, you will
also see the full output from the SEATS analysis.  An excerpt
from this is shown below.</p>
