<h1>gretl and X-12-ARIMA</h1>
</center>

<p>X-12-ARIMA is the program currently used by the U.S. Census Bureau
for seasonal adjustment.  The home page for this program is at <a
  href="http://www.census.gov/srd/www/x12a/">www.census.gov</a>.
Please look there for documentation and details.</p>

<p>Various packages are available that bundle X-12-ARIMA for use with gretl.
These include suitable executables for each platform plus documentation.
The version of X-12-ARIMA is 0.3 unless otherwise noted.</p>

For <b>Linux</b> there's an rpm,
<a href="http://ricardo.ecn.wfu.edu/pub/gretl/x12a-0.3-1.i586.rpm">x12a-0.3-1.i586.rpm</a>
or a a plain <kbd>tar.gz</kbd> package,
<a href="http://ricardo.ecn.wfu.edu/pub/gretl/x12arima-linux.tar.gz">x12arima-linux.tar.gz</a>.
There's also an older rpm of version 0.2.10,
<a href="http://ricardo.ecn.wfu.edu/pub/gretl/x12a-0.2.10-1.i386.rpm">x12a-0.2.10-1.i386.rpm</a>
(built on Red Hat Linux 7.3).</p>
   
<p>Self-installer for <b>MS Windows</b>, <a
  href="http://ricardo.ecn.wfu.edu/pub/gretl/x12a_install.exe">x12a_install.exe</a>.
  Contains the program in win32 console form.</p>

<p>Disk image for <b>MAC OS X</b>, <a
  href="http://ricardo.ecn.wfu.edu/pub/gretl/x12arima.dmg">x12arima.dmg</a>.</p>

<p>Support for X-12-ARIMA arrived in version 1.0.2 of gretl and at
present it is quite limited, but if there is interest in this feature
I will probably aim to develop it further.  The following pictures
illustrate what you can do as of now.</p>

<p>After opening a suitable data set (i.e. containing seasonal time
series), select a variable in the gretl main window and pull down the
Variable menu.  Select "X-12-ARIMA analysis".</p>

</center>

<p>You will then see a dialog box which gives you the choice of saving
(into the current gretl data set) up to three of the series generated
by X-12-ARIMA, namely the seasonally adjusted version of the input
series, the estimated trend/cycle component of the series, and the
estimated "irregular" component.  At this point you can also choose
whether or not to display a graph showing these series.</p>

<p>If you choose to display the graph, you should see something like
this:</p>

<IMG SRC="x12a-graph.png" ALT="x12a graph">
</center>

<p>Besides saving output series and displaying the graph, you will
also see the full output from the X-12-ARIMA analysis.  An excerpt
from this is shown below.</p>
