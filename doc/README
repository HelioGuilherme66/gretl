Documentation for gretl.  There's no need to do a "make" in here,
since the gretl source package comes with a pre-built manual in
both HTML and PDF.  You should "make" in here only if you know what
you're doing and have a fully functional installation of up-to-date
sgml tools and TeX (including pdfjadetex).  Even then you'll probably
have to edit the Makefile first.
