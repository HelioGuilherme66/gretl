Documentation for gretl.  There's no need to do a "make" in here,
since the gretl source package comes with a pre-built manual in
both text and PDF.  You should "make" in here only if you know what
you're doing and have a fully functional installation of up-to-date
XML tools and TeX (including pdflatex).  Even then you may have to
edit the Makefile first.
