# program to make a gretl database from FRED via their XML-delivering API

# make the program
make

# Note that to run the program you will need an API key from the
# St Louis fed: see http://api.stlouisfed.org/api_key.html.
# This should be placed in a file named api.key in the same
# directory as the program fred2db.

# You also need a file named fedstl.series which contains the
# names of the series to be included, one per line.

# You can then make the gretl db (fedstl.idx plus fedstl.bin)
make fedstl.idx
