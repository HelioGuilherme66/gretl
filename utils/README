This directory contains some scripts for creating gretl databases
out of economic data that are freely available over the web, from
economagic.com and nber.org.  See the subdirectories economagic and
nber for details.

Also provided: a script (and small patch) to automate the downloading,
building and installation of the X-12-ARIMA program on Linux. See the
subdir tramo_x12a.  At one time there was also a script to download and
install TRAMO for Linux, but the Bank of Spain has removed the files that
were required for this.
