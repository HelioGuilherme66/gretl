By default the gretl build uses gtk2, even if gtk3 is available
on the build system. You can switch to gtk3 by using the flag 
--enable-gtk3 with ./configure.

Most things should work fine with gtk3. You will, however, see 
a lot of deprecation messages with gtk >= 3.4.0. To cut out the
noise one can add -Wno-deprecated-declarations to CFLAGS when
building.
