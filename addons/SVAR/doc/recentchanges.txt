---- changelog in SVAR.tex updated up to here -----

--  New argument 'checkident' in SVAR_setup. Checking identification will become the default 
  in script use (SVAR_setup). This isn't yet 
  effective (Feb 22) because the implementation in SVAR_estimate isn't done yet, and neither 
  is the new version / bug fix of SVAR_ident.
