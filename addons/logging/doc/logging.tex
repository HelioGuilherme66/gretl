\section{Introduction}

This addon provides structured logging for gretl; that is, a means of
recording the history and progress of a computation as a log of
events. To make use of it you should insert the following statement
into your hansl code
\begin{code}
include logging.gfn
\end{code}

There are in principle two roles involved in logging---the
\textit{coder} (the writer of a hansl script or function package) and
the \textit{user} (the person running the script or
package)---although one person may play both roles.

The \textit{coder} gets to decide which events will be logged, and the
importance or ``level'' to be assigned to each event. This is done by
means of the logging functions \texttt{Debug}, \texttt{Info},
\texttt{Warn}, \texttt{Error} and \texttt{Critical} (in increasing
order of importance).  Each of these functions requires a single
string argument and offers no return value. For example, the signature
of \texttt{Info} is
\begin{code}
void Info (const string msg)
\end{code}

The \textit{user} determines which log messages will be shown, by
selecting a threshold: print only messages of a specified level or
above.  This is done via the command
\begin{code}
set loglevel <level>
\end{code}
where \verb|<level>| can be given by number or name, as shown below.

\begin{center}
  \begin{tabular}{cll}
    number & name & associated function \\[4pt]
    0 & \texttt{debug} & \texttt{Debug}\\
    1 & \texttt{info} & \texttt{Info}\\
    2 & \texttt{warn} & \texttt{Warn}\\
    3 & \texttt{error} & \texttt{Error}\\
    4 & \texttt{critical} & \texttt{Critical}
  \end{tabular}
\end{center}

The default level is 2 or \texttt{warn}, so messages set via the
\texttt{Debug} and \texttt{Info} functions will not be printed unless
the user specifies a lower threshold. A user who does not care to see
warning messages can raise the threshold to 3 or \texttt{error}.

\section{Remarks}

Using structured logging provides some advantages over using
\texttt{print} or \texttt{printf} statements:
\begin{enumerate}
\item It gives control over the visibility and presentation of
  messages without editing the source code. For example, the code
\begin{code}
  Debug("This is a debugging message")
\end{code}
  will produce no output by default; such messages are printed only
  if the user selects a verbose level of logging.
\item It's cheap to leave debugging statements like this in the source
  code: the program evaluates the message only if it is currently
  called for.
\item Log messages can have timestamps, and can be written to a
  separate file which can be analysed afterwards. More on these
  points below.
\end{enumerate}

Note that the message passed to a logging function does not have to a
fixed piece of text. You can incorporate current state information by
means of the \texttt{sprintf} function, as in this example
\begin{code}
  Warn(sprintf("The matrix X looks funny:\n%g\n", X))
\end{code}
which prints the elements of \texttt{X} following the message.

The table below may be helpful in determining which level of logging
to use for which purpose.\footnote{It is borrowed from
  \url{https://docs.python.org/3/howto/logging.html}.}

\begin{center}
  \begin{tabular}{lp{0.7\textwidth}}
    Debug & Detailed information, typically of interest only when diagnosing
            problems.\\
    Info & Confirmation that things are working as expected.\\
    Warn & An indication that something unexpected happened, or indicative of some
           problem in the near future (e.g.\ ``disk space low''). The software is still working
           as expected.\\
    Error & Due to a more serious problem, the software has not been able to perform
            some function.\\
    Critical & A serious error, indicating that the program itself may be unable to
               continue running.
  \end{tabular}
\end{center}

\section{Timestamps}

Optionally, the user can arrange for each logging message to show a
timestamp. This is achieved via the command
\begin{code}
set logstamp on
\end{code}
And timestamps can be turned off via ``\texttt{set logstamp off}''.

Suppose a function contains the following statement, triggered when an
argument \texttt{x} is negative:
\begin{code}
Warn("x is negative")
\end{code}
Without a timestamp the output will be
\begin{code}
WARNING: x is negative
\end{code}
With a timestamp it will resemble the following, showing date, time
and time-zone:
\begin{code}
WARNING 2021-07-08 10:26:44 EDT: x is negative
\end{code}

\section{Logging to file}

By default log messages are printed to the same place (window, file,
or whatever) as regular program output. But the \texttt{set} variable
\texttt{logfile} can be used to redirect logging output. For example,
if you specify
\begin{code}
set logfile "mylog.txt"
\end{code}
logging output will go \texttt{mylog.txt}. Note that when a simple
filename is given, as above, the file will be written in the user's
working directory. To take control over its location you can supply a
full path. You can also specify the ``file'' as \texttt{stdout} or
\texttt{stderr} (without quotes) to send logging to the standard
output or standard error streams, respectively.

\section{A simple example}

Listing~\ref{listing:simple-ex} illustrates usage on the part of both
coder (in the function \texttt{testlog}) and user. You can try
uncommenting the ``\texttt{set}'' lines in the main script to see
their effect.

\begin{script}[htbp]
\begin{scode}
include logging.gfn

function void testlog (scalar x)
   Debug("Here in function testlog")
   Info(sprintf("testlog: x = %g", x))
   if missing(x)
       Error("x value is invalid")
   elif x < 0
       Warn("x is negative")
   endif
end function

/* main script */

# set loglevel info
# set logstamp on
# set loglevel debug
testlog(3)
testlog(-1)
testlog(NA)
\end{scode}
\caption{Sample usage of logging functionality}
\label{listing:simple-ex}  
\end{script}

\section{Accessors}

The settings of \texttt{loglevel}, \texttt{logstamp} and
\texttt{logfile} can be accessed via \dollar{loglevel},
\dollar{logstamp} and \dollar{logfile}, respectively. The first two
acessors return a numerical value (0/1 for \texttt{logstamp});
\dollar{logfile} returns an empty string if redirection is not
set. However, these accessors are basically internals of the addon,
unlikely to be of interest to its users.
