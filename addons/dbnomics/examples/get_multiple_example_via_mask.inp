### the DBnomics dataset we're drawing from
provider = "IMF"
database = "CPI"

# the mask: the substring "FR+DE+BE" means "France, Germany and Belgium"
# an empty field, like "M..PCPIT_IX", means "all"
bundle spec = defbundle("mask", "Q.FR+DE+BE.PCPIT_IX")

### now we get the series
bs = dbnomics_get_multiple(provider, database, 20, 0, spec)
dbnomics_bundles_print(bs)
