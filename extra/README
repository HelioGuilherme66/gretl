simple_client.c is code for a trivial illustrative client program for
libgretl, "client".  By looking at this code you should be able to get
the basic idea of how to send information to libgretl, and how one might
deal with the struct that libgretl returns.  You should install the
gretl library and headers (i.e. "make install" in the parent to this
directory) before trying to compile the client.
