This directory contains some odds and ends that might be useful to some
people.

simple_client.c is code for a trivial illustrative client program for
libgretl, "client".  By looking at this code you should be able to get
the basic idea of how to send information to libgretl, and how one might
deal with the struct that libgretl returns.  You should install the
gretl library and headers (i.e. "make install" in the parent to this
directory) before trying to compile the client.

nist.tgz contains NIST's statistical reference datasets (linear 
regression and univariate summary stats series) in a form directly 
readable by gretl, along with scripts (*.tst) to generate the benchmark 
regressions.  See
http://www.nist.gov/itl/div898/strd/general/main.html

The .tex files illustrate gretl's capacity to write out OLS models in
LaTeX markup.
