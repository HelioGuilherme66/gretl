The material in here has been hived off in the form of "plugins" 
(loaded dynamically at run time if needed) for various reasons.

* The stats_tables and panel_data plugins (look-up of critical values
  for common distributions, and hypothesis testing in relation to
  pooled cross-section time-series models, respectively) have
  been separated out in an attempt to avoid "bloat", since they
  are likely to be used less than other features of gretl.

* The progress_bar plugin (display progress of a possibly time-
  consuming operation via GTK) has been separated so that its
  functionality can be accessed via the libgretl library, without
  the need to link the latter against glib and gtk.
