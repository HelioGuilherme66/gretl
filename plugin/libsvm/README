The files in this directory are taken from libsvm-3.23, dated

svmlib.h is a renamed copy of the library's header file, svm.h.

svmlib.cpp is a renamed version of svm.cpp, edited to support
parallelization via OpenMP when the symbol _OPENMP is defined. The
changes are as described in answer to "How can I use OpenMP to
parallelize LIBSVM on a multicore/shared-memory computer?" in the
file FAQ.html in the libsvm distribution. In addition, the random
numbers used in cross validation are taken from libgretl's SFMT
(Mersenne Twister), in place of the C library's rand().
