The files in this directory are taken from libsvm-3.23, the
copyright notice for which is included.

svmlib.h is a renamed copy of the library's header file, with
the symbol SVM_USE_MT defined (see below).

svmlib.cpp is a renamed version of svm.cpp, edited to support
parallelization via OpenMP when the symbol _OPENMP is defined. The
changes are as described in answer to "How can I use OpenMP to
parallelize LIBSVM on a multicore/shared-memory computer?" in the
file FAQ.html in the libsvm distribution. In addition, conditional
on the definition of SVM_USE_MT, the random numbers used in cross
validation are taken from libgretl's SFMT (Mersenne Twister), in
place of the C library's rand().
