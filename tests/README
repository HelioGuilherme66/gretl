Here's a checker program that runs libgretl against the NIST reference
datasets for linear regression, for details on which see

http://www.nist.gov/itl/div898/strd/general/main.html

If all is well there should be exactly one failure, namely libgretl
will not be able to obtain estimates on the Filip model (a 10th degree
polynomial which exhibits very high collinearity).  Any other failures
should be cause for concern.

The checker program reads the "certified values" and data out of each
NIST file, runs a regression using libgretl, and compares the libgretl
estimates with the certified values, starting at a precision of 9
significant figures.  If there is any disagreement, the comparison is
repeated using 8 significant figures, and so on.  If the figures do
not agree at a precision of at least 6 figures, the test is deemed to
have failed and an error message is printed.

You can get more details on gretl's performance on the tests by
running the 'nistcheck' program in verbose mode (-v flag) or very
verbose mode (-vv).
