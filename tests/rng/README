Rig for testing gretl's random number generator.

Prerequisites: 

* libgretl must be installed, along with its headers and pkg-config .pc file

* The TestU01 library (P. L'Ecuyer and R. Simard) must be installed --
  see http://simul.iro.umontreal.ca/testu01/tu01.html. As of this
  writing the current version is TestU01-1.2.3.

Given the above, adjust the lines at the top of the Makefile in this 
directory if needed for your system, then type "make" to build the 
program "gretltest". To see what options this program offers, invoke

./gretltest --help

Note that the default test suite is "SmallCrush", which runs fast but is
not very stringent. To run the more stringent "Crush" suite, do

./gretltest --size=1 > Crush.out

This test is likely to take a couple of hours or so.

To run the extremely stringent "BigCrush" (which may take upwards of
12 hours) do

./gretltest --size=2 > BigCrush.out

One or two "failures" (p-values quite close to 0 or 1) are to be expected 
when running BigCrush.
