.SH "DESCRIPTION"
gretl is an econometrics package, built around a shared
library which may be accessed using a command\-line client
program (\fBgretlcli\fR) or a graphical user interface
(\fBgretl_x11\fR).  The program \fBgretl\fR is a wrapper script that
calls the GUI if the DISPLAY environment variable is set, otherwise
the command\-line client.  

For details, please start up either the GUI or the
command\-line client and consult the online help, or read the
printed manual, which is available in PDF format via the
gretl website, \fBhttp://gretl.sourceforge.net\fR.
